25 years and my life is still
i'm trying to get up that
great big hill of hope
for a destination

i realized quickly when i knew i should
that the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
for whatever that means

and so i cry sometimes when i'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and i am feeling a little peculiar

and so i wake in the morning and i step outside
and i take a deep breath and i get real high
and i scream from the top of my lungs
what's goin' on

and i say, hey hey hey hey i say hey, what's going on?
and i say, hey hey hey hey i say hey, what's going on?

ooh, ooh ooh...

and i try, oh my god do i try
i try all the time in this institution

and i pray, oh my god do i pray
i pray every single day for a revolution

and so i cry sometimes when i'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and i am feeling a little peculiar

and so i wake in the morning and i step outside
and i take a deep breath then i get real high
and i scream from the top of my lungs
what's goin' on

and i say, hey hey hey hey i say hey, what's going on?
and i say, hey hey hey hey i say hey, what's going on...

25 years and my life is still
i'm trying to get up that
great big hill of hope
for a destination.
