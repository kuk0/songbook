CAPO 3

[Am]There's a fire starting in my heart,
[F]Reaching a fever pitch and it's [G]bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
See how I leave, with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

[chorus:]
[F]The scars of your [G]love, remind me of [Em]us.
They keep me [F]thinking that we almost had it [F]all
The scars of your [G]love, they leave me [Em]breathless
I can't help [E]feeling... 
We could have had it [Am]all[C]...
Rolling in the [F]Deep[G]
Your had my heart [Am]inside of your [C]hand
And you [F]played it to the beat[G]

[Am]Baby I have no story to be told, but
[E]I've heard one of you and I'm [G]gonna make your head burn.
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

[chorus]

[Am]Throw yourself through ever open door (Whoa)
Count your blessings to find what look for (Whoa-uh)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)
And pay me back in kind- You reap just what you sow.

[chorus]
