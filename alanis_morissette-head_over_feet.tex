[C, G, Am, F]
I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case time and again
I thought about it

You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was

[chorus:]
You've already [D]won me [Bm]over [G]in spite of [A]me
Don't be [D]alarmed if I [Bm]fall [Bb]head over [A]feet
Don't be [D]surprised if I [Bm]love you
for [G]all that you [A]are
[F]I couldn't [C]help it [G]It's all your fault

Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service

[chorus]

You are the bearer of unconditional things
You held your breath and the door for me
Thanks for your patience

You're the best listener that I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long
I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now
I am aware now, [chorus]
