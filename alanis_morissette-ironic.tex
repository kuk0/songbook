An [D]old [G]man [D]turned ninety-[Em]eight   
He won the [D]lotte[G]ry and [D]died the next [Em]day
It's a [D]black [G]fly in [D]your [Em]Chardonnay
It's a [D]death row [G]pardon two [D]minutes too [Em]late
Isn't it [D]ironic [G] don't you [D]think [Em]

[chorus]
It's like [D]rain [G]on your [D]wedding [Em]day
It's a free [D]ride [G]when you've [D]already [Em]paid
It's the good [D]advice [G]that you [D]just didn't [Em]take
[F]Who would've [C]thought ... it fi[D]gures 

Mr. [D]Play It [G]Safe was [D]afraid to [Em]fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
"Well isn't this nice ... "
And isn't it ironic ... don't you think 

[chorus]

Well [Cmaj7]life has a funny way of [D]sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay
and [Cmaj7]everything's going [D]right 
And [Cmaj7]life has a funny way of helping you [D]out when
You think everything's gone wrong
and [Cmaj7]everything blows up in your [D]face

A [D]traffic [G]jam when you're [D]already [Em]late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
and then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic ... don't you think
A little too ironic ... and yeah I really do think ...

[chorus]

[Cmaj7]Life has a funny way of [D]sneaking up on you
[Cmaj7]Life has a funny, funny way ---
of [D]helping you out [Cmaj7] helping you out
