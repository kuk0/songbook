\begin{verbatim}
[Em]I want you to know that [A]I'm happy for you.
[Em]I wish nothing but the [A]best for you both.
Another [Em]version of me Is she preverted like me?
Would she go [A]down on you in a theatre?
Does she speak [Em]eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm [A]sure she'd make a really excellent mother.

'Cause the [Em]love that you gave that we made
wasn't able to [G]make it enough for you to be [A]open wide. No,
and [Em]everytime you speak her name
does she [G]know how you told me you'd hold me
un[A]til you died? `Til you died,
but you're still alive.

chorus:
And I'm [E]here to re[D]mind you
of the [G]mess you left when you [A]went away.
It's not [E]fair to [D]deny me
of the [G]cross I bare that you [A]gave to me.
You, you, you oughta know.

You seem very well. Things look peaceful.
I'm not quite as well. I thought you should know.
      
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced,
and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide. No,
and everytime you speak her name
does she know how you told me you'd hold me
until you died? `Til you died, but you're still alive.

[chorus]
              
Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me,
and I'm not gonna fadeas soon as you close your eyes, and you know it.
And everytime I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it. Can you feel it?

[chorus]
