[C#m]Your cruel [A]device [E]Your blood, [B]like ice
[F#m]One look [D]could kill [A]My pain, [C#]your thrill

[chorus:]
[F#m]I want to [D]love you but I [A]better not [C#]touch
[Bm]I want to [G]hold you but my [D]senses tell me [A]to stop
[G#m]I want to [E]kiss you but I [B]want it too [F#]much
[C#m]I want to [A]taste you but your [E]lips are [B]venomous
[C#m]poison [A,E,B]
You're [C#m]poison [A]running [E]through my [B]veins
You're [C#m]poison [A,E,B]
[C#m]I don't [A]want to [E]break these [B]chains

[C#m]Your mouth, [A]so hot [E]Your web, [B]I'm caught
[F#m]Your skin, [D]so wet [A]Black lace [C#]on sweat

[F#m]I hear you [D]calling and it's [A]needles and [C#]pins
[Bm]I wanna hurt you [G]just to hear you [D]screaming my [A]name
[G#m]Don't want to [E]touch you but you're [B]under my [F#]skin
[C#m]I want to [A]kiss you but your [E]lips are [B]venomous
[C#m]poison [A,E,B]
You're [C#m]poison [A]running [E]through my [B]veins
You're [C#m]poison [A,E,B]
[C#m]I don't [A]want to [E]break these [B]chains
You're [C#m]poison [A,E,B]

[F#m]One look [D]could kill [A]My pain, [C#]your thrill

[chorus]

[C#m, A, E, B]
Poison, oh no... Runnin' deep inside my veins,
Burnin' deep inside my veins, It's poison...
I don't wanna break these chains
