[Dm, Gm, Bb7, A7]

He left no time to re-gret,
Kept his dick wet, with his same old safe bet.
Me...and my head high,
And my tears dry; get on without my guy.

You went back to what you knew,
So far removed, from all that we went through.
And I...tread a troubled track,
My odds are stacked; I'll go back to black.

We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
You go back to her and I go back to...I go back to us.

I love you much, it's not e-nough;
You love blow and I love puff.
And life is like a pipe,
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside.

We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
You go back to her and I go back to...
We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
You go back to her and I go back to...

[Dm]Black... [Gm]black,
[F]Black... [A7]black.
Black...black,
Black...I go back to...I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
You go back to her and I go back to...
We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
You go back to her and I go back to black.
