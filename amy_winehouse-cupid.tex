G      Em 
Cupid draw back your bow 
G         C 
And let your arrow flow 
G               D                 G 
Straight to my lover's heart for me 
C      D       
Nobody but me  
G      Em                   
Cupid please hear my cry 
G         C 
And let your arrow fly 
G               D                 G    F  G    D   
Straight to my lover's heart for me 

G                              D 
I don't want to bother you but I'm in distress 
                                    G 
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness 
                              C 
For I love a male who doesn't know I exist 
D                 G   D   
and this you can fix, so 

[chorus]
G                                    D 
Now, if your arrow makes his love strong for me 
                                  G 
I swear I'm gonna love him until eternity 
                                        C 
I know that â€˜tween the both of us his heart we can steal 
D                     G     D 
Cupid help me if you will, so
