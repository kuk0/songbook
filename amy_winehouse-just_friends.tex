[Amaj9, Bm7/A (x2)]

[chorus:]
[Amaj9]When will we get, [Bm7/A|Dm6]the time to be,
[Amaj9]Just friends? [Bm7/A|Dm6]

[Bm7] It's never safe for us,
[E7]Not even in the [Amaj9]evening; 'cos [Dmaj7]I've been drinking.
[F#7] Not in the morning, when your [Bm7]shit works.

                     
[Bm]It's always [E7]dangerous,
When everybody's [Amaj9]sleeping and [Dmaj7]I've been thinking.
[F#7]Can we be alone, can we [G]be alone?

[chorus]

[Bm7]And no I'm not [E7]ashamed,
But the guilt will kill [Amaj9]you, if she [Dmaj7]don't first.
[F#7]I'll never love you [Bm7]like her.

[Bm7]Though we need to find the [E7]time,
To just do this shit [Amaj9]to-gether; for [Dmaj7]it gets worse.
[F#7]I wanna touch you, but [G]that just hurts.

[chorus]

[Bm7, E7, Amaj9, Dmaj7, F#7, Bm7]

[chorus] ...just [Amaj9]friends?
