[chorus]
They [C7]try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.
[G7]I ain't got the time and if my [F7]daddy thinks I'm fine;
He's [C7]tried to make me go to [F7]rehab; I won't [C7]go, go, go.

[Em] I'd rather be at [Am]home with Ray,
[F]I ain't got seventy [G#]days.
'Cos there's [Em]nothing, there's nothing you can [Am]teach me,
That [F]I can't learn from [G#]Mr Hathaway.

[G7]I didn't get a lot in class,
But I [F7]know it don't come in a shot glass.

[chorus]

[Em] The man said why do you [Am]think you here?
[F] I said; I got no [G#]idea.
[Em]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, lose my [Am]baby,
[F]So I always keep a [G#]bottle near.

[G7]He said I just think you're depressed,
[F7]Yes me, yeah baby and the rest.

[chorus]

[Em]I don't ever want to [Am]drink again,
[F]I just, ooh I just, [G#]need a friend.
[Em]I'm not gonna spend [Am]ten weeks,
And [F]have everyone think [G#]I've gone mad.

[G7]And it's not just my pride;
[F7]It's just 'till these tears have dried.
