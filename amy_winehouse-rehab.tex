[chorus]
[C7]They try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.
[G7]I ain't got the time and if my [F7]daddy thinks I'm fine;
He's [C7]tried to make me go to [F7]rehab; I won't [C7]go, go, go.

[Em] I'd rather be at home [Am]with Ray, [F]I ain't got seventy [Ab]days.
'Cos there's [Em]nothing, there's nothing you can [Am]teach me,
That [F]I can't learn from Mr [Ab]Hathaway.

[G7] I didn't get a lot in class,
But [F7]I know it don't come in a shot glass.

[chorus]

[Em] The man said why do you think you [Am]here? [F]I said; I got no [Ab]idea.
[Em] I'm gonna, I'm gonna, lose my [Am]baby,
[F] So I always keep a [Ab]bottle near.

[G7] He said I just think you're depressed,
[F7] Yes me, yeah baby and the rest.

[C7] They try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.

[Em] I don't ever want to [Am]drink again,
[F] I just, ooh I just, [Ab]need a friend.
[Em] I'm not gonna spend [Am]ten weeks,
And [F]have everyone think I've [Ab]gone mad.

[G7] And it's not just my pride;
[F7] It's just 'till these tears have dried.
