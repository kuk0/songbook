all i can ever be to you, is a darkness that we knew,
and this regret i got accustomed to.

once it was so right, when we were at our high,
waiting for you in the ho-tel at night.

i knew i hadn't met my match,
but every moment we could snatch.
i don't know why i got so attached.

it's my responsibility,
and you don't owe nothing to me,
but to walk away; i have no ca-pacity.

chorus 1:
he walks away;   the sun goes down.
he takes the day, but i'm grown.
and in this grey, in this blue shade,
my tears dry on their own.

i don't understand; why do i stress a man,
when there's so many better things at hand?

we could a never had it amaj7ll; we had to hit a wall,
so this is in-evita-ble withdrawal.

even if i stop wanting you,
a perspective pushes through,
i'll be some next man's other woman soon.

i can't play myself again,
i should just be my own best friend,
not fuck myself in the head with stupid men.

chorus 2:
he walks away;   the sun goes down.
he takes the day, but i'm grown.
and in this grey, in this blue shade,
my tears dry on their own.

bridge 1:
so we are history; your shadow covers me,
the sky above, a blaze...

chorus:
he walks away;   the sun goes down.
he takes the day, but i'm grown.
and in your wake, in this blue shade,
my tears dry on their own.

i wish i could say no regrets, and no e-motional debts,
'cos as we kiss good-bye the sun sets.

so we are history; the shadow covers me,

the sky above a blaze that only lovers see.

chorus 4:
he walks away;   the sun goes down.
he takes the day, but i'm grown.
and in this grey, in this blue shade,
my tears dry on their own.
