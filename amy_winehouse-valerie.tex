[C Dm]  [F Em G]

well [C]sometimes i go out, by myslef,
and i look across the [Dm]water.
and i [C]think of all the things,
of what you're doing, and i paint a [Dm]picture.

chorus:
[F]since i've come home, well my [Em]body's been a mess, and
i [F]miss your tender hair, and the [Em]way you like to dress.
[F]oh wont you come on over, [Em]stop making a fool
out of [G]me, why dont you come on over, [C]valerie
[Dm]valerie [C]valerie [Dm] valerie

did you [C]have to go to jail, put your house out up for sale,
did you get a good [Dm]lawyer.
i hope you [C]didnt catch a tan, i hope you find the right man,
who'll fix it [Dm]for you.
are you [C]shopping anywhere, change the color of your hair,
and are you [Dm]busy.
did you [C]have to pay that fine,
that you were dodging all the time, are you still [Dm]dizzy.

[chorus]

well [C]sometimes i go out, by myslef,
and i look across the [Dm]water.
and i [C]think of all the things,
of what you're doing, and i paint a [Dm]picture.
