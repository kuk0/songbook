\begin{verbatim}
[Dm]Meet you downstairs in the [Gm]bar and heard
Your [A7]rolled up sleeves in your [Dm]skull t-shirt
You say, [Dm]What did you do with [Gm]him today?
And [A7]sniffed me out like I was [Dm]Tanqueray
[Gm]Cause you're my fella, my guy
[E7]Hand me your stella and fly
[F]By the time I'm out the door
You [E7]tear men down like [A7]Roger Moore

[chorus]
[Dm]I cheated myself[Am] like I [E7]knew I [Am]would
I [Dm]told ya I was [Am]trouble,
you [E7]know that I'm no [Am]good

[Dm]Upstairs in bed with [Gm]my ex boy
[A7]He's in a place but I [Dm]can't get joy
[Dm]Thinking of you in the [Gm]final throws
[A7]This is when my [Dm]buzzer goes
[Gm]Run out to meet your chips and pitta
[E7]You say, When we're married, cause you're not bitter
[F]There'll be none of him no more
I [E7]cried for you on the [A7]kitchen floor

[chorus]

[Dm]Sweet reunion, Ja[Gm]maica and Spain
[A7]We're like how we [Dm]were again
[Dm]I'm in the tub, you [Gm]on the seat
[A7]Lick your lips as I [Dm]soak my feet
[Gm]Then you notice little carpet burn
[E7]My stomach drops and my guts churn
[F]You shrug and it's the worst
To [E7]truly stuck the [A7]knife in first
[chorus 2x]
