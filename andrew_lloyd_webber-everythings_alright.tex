Surely you're not saying we have the resources
To save the poor from their lot ?
There will be poor always, pathetic'lly struggling -
Look at the good things you've got !
Think!  While you still have me
Move!  While you still see me
You'll be lost, you'll be so sorry when I'm gone

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and anoit you
Myrth for your hot forehead ah then you'll feel
Ev'rything's alright yes ev'rything's fine
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes, close your eyes
And relax think of nothing tonight
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes

Ev'rything's alright, yes, ev'rything's alright, yes
