         D    G     D      A
D   G    D            G    D
I don't know how to love him
G         G6   G    A
What to do how to move him
            D    A             D        A
I've been changed yes really changed
        F#m7      Bm            F#m7    Bm
In this past few days when I've seen myself
   G    D    Em Em7 A     A7
I seem like someone else

D
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he woos me
He's a man he's just a man
And I've had so many men before
In very many ways ...
He's just one more             D

G                       F#7                       Bm
Should I bring him down, should I scream and shout
Bm/A      G                     D/A
Should I speak of love, let my feelings out
           C         G        D
I never thought I'd come to this -
G            D      A
What's it all about ?..

D
Don't You think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm so cool, no lovers fool
Running every show ...
He scares me so

I never thought I'd come to this -
What's it all about

Yet if he said he loved me
I'd be lost I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know ...
He scares me so !
I want him so,
I love him so ...
