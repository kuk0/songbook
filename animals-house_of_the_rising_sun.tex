There [Am]is a [C]house in [D]New Orleans[F]
They [Am]call the [C]Risin' [E]Sun[E]
And it's [Am]been the [C]ruin of [D]many a poor [F]boy.
And [Am]God, I [E]know I'm [Am]one.
[C, D, F, Am, E, Am, E]

My [Am]mother [C]was a [D]tailor.[F]
She [Am]sewed my [C]new blue [E]jeans.[E]
My [Am]father [C]was a [D]gamblin' [F]man
[Am]Down in [E]New Or[Am]leans.
[C, D, F, Am, E, Am, E]

Now, the [Am]only [C]thing a [D]gambler [F]needs
Is a [Am]suitcase [C]and a [E]trunk[E]
And the [Am]only [C]time that [D]he's satis[F]fied
Is [Am]when he's [E]on a [Am]drunk
[C, D, F, Am, E, Am, E]

Oh, [Am]Mother, [C]tell your [D]children[F]
Not to [Am]do what [C]I have [E]done.[E]
[Am]Spend your [C]lives in [D]sin and mise[F]ry
In the [Am]house of the [E]risin' [Am]sun.
[C, D, F, Am, E, Am, E]

Well, I've [Am]got one [C]foot on the [D]platform.[F]
the [Am]other [C]foot on the [E]train.[E]
I'm [Am]goin' [C]back to [D]New Or[F]leans
To [Am]wear that [E]ball and [Am]chain.
[C, D, F, Am, E, Am, E]

Well, there [Am]is a [C]house in [D]New Orleans[F]
They [Am]call the [C]Risin' [E]Sun[E]
And it's [Am]been the [C]ruin of [D]many a poor [F]boy.
And [Am]God, I [E]know I'm [Am]one.
