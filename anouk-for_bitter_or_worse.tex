(Em) Haven't we both heard enough babe This is what we're gonna (C)do
(Em) Let me put my arms around you once more There's nothing left here to(C)prove

(Em) Walk away just a little bit slower
Better hold on tight, will we ever learn to let it (C)go
(Em) Break Through to the other side I keep wondering
When were you ever gonna let me know (C)
That you (Am) just wanted something else in life 

[chorus]
(C) What do you (Bm)say when it's all (Am) over
(C) What do you (Bm)know when nothing's going right
The (Em)troubles in your mind 
(C) What do you do (B) when you get (Em) lost (D) inside (C) your (Bm) soul (Am)
Where do you go when love's (B) gone
What do you say nothing at all (Em)

(Em) It was so hard when I watched you falling down But it was time for you to walk (C)alone
(Em) Just know if you really need a friend And you're feeling like you can't go (C)on 

(Em) Just walk back just a little bit faster Take my hand I will blow your fears (C)away
(Em) Break through to the other side For bitter or worse I know you better than anyone (C)else
And (Am) I'll be by your side 

[chorus]

(Am) When it all becomes reality
(F) That this is where it ends for you and me
(D) I'm about to lose my mind
(E) Will love find a way on time
(Am) Please don't try and kiss these tears away
(F) We know we've both have made mistakes
(D) If I could do it all again
(E) I wouldn't change a single thing
 
(F) What do you say (Em) when it's all (Am) over
(F) What do you (Em) know when nothing's going right (Am)
(F) What do you do (E) when you get (Am) lost (G) in (F#m)side (Em) your (Dm) soul
Where do you go when love's (E) gone
What do you say nothing at all (Am)
What do you say nothing at all (Am)
What do you say nothing at all (Am)
