[D, A, G]
Hey Michel how's life are you ok
I wonder if you ever think of me
It's been 9 years since that kiss
I can't [A]help but reminisce
Hey Michel do you remember

[chorus:]
We [D]walked the street to the beat
[A]Hand in hand you and [G]me
[D]Smiling faces so in love
[A]Hoping that they all could [G]see
That [A]we belonged [D]together you and [A]me against the [G]world
But [A]we found out the [D]hard way cause it [A]wasn't meant to [G]be
Now  it's you and her I see

[D, A, G]
You were my first and worst love
And so it only could go wrong
But ain't that just the way you learn
Hey Michel I just wanted to let you know
That someone else has stolen my heart
And now another girl has caught your eye
That doesn't mean I don't think of you
I am just hoping that she'll treat you right

Do you remember
[chorus]

[D, A, G]
       It was just a silly dream
lalalaaah laah laah laah laah
lalalaaah laah laah laah laah laah
lalalaaah laah laah laah laah
Hey Michel, do you remember
