[capo 6th fret]
[F, E, Am, Am6, Am7, Am]
Did you ever wake up in the morning
With a freight-train running through your head
An empty whiskey bottle by your pillow
And a burned out unfinished cigarette
The night went up in smoke
Life is but a joke man
But I see nobody laughing

Did you ever live a day
Like the next day would never come
Blood's dripping on the floor, but who cares
Who needs you anyway
You're a stranger to yourself
And this ain't no joke man
But I can't stop laughing

[chorus]
[C]Greedy, [Dm]angry [F]people make me
[G]Run around in circles [Am]backwards
[C]Down the [Dm]lonely [F]road that keeps me
[G]Run around in [Am]circles

Have you ever found yourself drowning
In a dark and crowded bar
The barman keeps on pouring and you're kissing everyone
The night will never end no
'Cause my horse is still saddled up
That's why I can't stop laughing

[chorus]

[F, G, Am]
How I want to try again
Excuse me can you lead the way
just take me by the..
[chorus]

How I want to try again
Excuse me can you lead the way
Just take me by the hand
[F, E, Am]
How I want to try....
