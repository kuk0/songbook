D                 Bm               F#m
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
Em7                                    A                  A7
They slither while they pass they slip away across the Universe.
D                Bm               F#m
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Em7              Gm
Possessing and caressing me.

D	  Bm		     F#m	   		    Em7
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
			A		   A7
They call me on and on across the Universe.
D		 Bm		 F#m
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
     Em7			       A                 A7
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the Universe.
