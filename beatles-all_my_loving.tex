Close your [Dm]eyes and I'll [G7]kiss you
to[C]morrow I'll [Am]miss you,
re[F]member I'll a[Dm]lways be [Bb]true. [G]
And then [Dm]while I'm [G]away I'll write [C]home every [Am]day,
and I'll [F]send all my [G7]loving to [C]you.

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
the lips I am missing
and hope that my dreams will come true.
And then while I'm away I'll write home every day,
and I'll send all my loving to you.

All my [Am]loving - [C+]I will send to you[C]
all my [Am]loving, [C+]Darling I'll be [C]true.
