\begin{verbatim}
Well she was [A]just seventeen,
if you [D7]know what I [A]mean,
And the way she looked was way beyond com[E7]pare,
[A]So how could I [A7]dance with a[D]nother,[F]
when I [A]saw her [E7]standing [A]there.

Well [A]she looked at me, and [D7]I, I could [A]see, 
That before too long I'd fall in love with [E7]her.
[A]She wouldn't [A7]dance with a[D]nother,[F]
when I [A]saw her [E7]standing [A]there.

Well my [D7]heart went boom when I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in [E]mine... [D]

Well we [A]danced through the night,
and we [D7]held each other [A]tight,
And before too long I fell in love with [E7]her.
[A]Now I'll never [A7]dance with a[D]nother,[F]
since I [A]saw her [E7]standing [A]there.

Well my [D7]heart went boom when I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in [E]mine... [D]

Well we [A]danced through the night,
and we [D7]held each other [A]tight,
And before too long I fell in love with [E7]her.
[A]Now I'll never [A7]dance with a[D]nother,[F]
since I [A]saw her [E7]standing [A]there.
Since I [A]saw her [E7]standing [A]there.
Since I [A]saw her [E7]standing [A]there.
