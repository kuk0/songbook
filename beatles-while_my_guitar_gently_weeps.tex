  Am           Am/G       Am6                 Fmaj7
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Am          G          D        E
While my guitar gently weeps
  Am           Am/G       Am6                 Fmaj7
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Am          G          C        E
Still my guitar gently weeps
 
A            Amaj7  F#m  A      Bm                  E
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
A            Amaj7  F#m     A
I don't know how someone controlled you
Bm                   E
They bought and sold you
 
  Am           Am/G       Am6         Fmaj7
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
Am          G          D        E
While my guitar gently weeps
  Am             Am/G      Am6       Fmaj7
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Am          G          C        E
Still my guitar gently weeps
 
A            Amaj7  F#m     A
I don't know how you were diverted
Bm                 E
You were perverted too
A            Amaj7  F#m     A
I don't know how you were inverted
Bm             E
No one alerted you
 
  Am           Am/G       Am6                 Fmaj7
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Am          G          D        E
While my guitar gently weeps
  Am           Am/G       Am6                 Fmaj7
Look at you all...
Am          G          C        E
Still my guitar gently weeps
