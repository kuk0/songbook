I know your [E]eyes in the [G#m7]morning [F#m7]sun
[C#7]I feel you [F#m7]touch me in the [G#7]pouring [Amaj7/B]rain
And the [E]moment that you [G#m7]wander [C#m7]far from me
I wanna [F#m7]feel you in my [Amaj7/B]arms again

And you [Amaj7]come to me on a [G#m7]summer breeze
Keep me [F#m7]warm in your love, then you [D9]softly leave
And it's [G#m7]me you need to show[Amaj7/B]
How deep is your [E]love

Chorus:
[Emaj7] How deep is your love
[Amaj7]I really mean to [Am6]learn
'Cause we're [E]living in a world of [G#m7-5/D]fools
breaking us [C#7]down
When they all should let us [F#m7]be
We [Am6]belong to you and [E]me

Verse 2:
I be[G#m7]lieve in [F#m7]you
[C#7]You know the [F#m7]door to my [G#7]very [Amaj7/B]soul
You're the [E]light in my [G#m7]deepest, [C#m7]darkest night
You're my [F#m7]savior when I [Amaj7/B]fall

And [Amaj7]you may not think I [G#m7]care for you
When you [F#m7]know down inside that I [D9]really do
And it's [G#m7]me you need to show[Amaj7/B]
How deep is your [E]love
