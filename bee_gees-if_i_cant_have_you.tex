Intro:   Am    Bm     Em   Bm    A   Bm   C  F G F C F G
 
Don't know [D]why  
I'm [Gm]surviving every lonely [D]day,  
when it's [A]got to be  
no [G]chance for me.  
My life would [D]end,  
 
and it [Gm]doesn't matter how I [D]cry
my [A]tears of love,  
are a [G]waste of time.  
If I [A]turn away,  
am I [G]strong enough to see it [Em]through?  
Go [G]crazy is just what I'll [A11]do.
 
If I [Bm]can't have you,  
I don't [A]want nobody, baby.  
If I [F#m] can't have you.  
Ah [Bm]Ah.  
 
If I can't have you,  
I don't [A]want nobody, baby.  
If I [F#m]can't have you.  
Ah  [Bm]ah.
 
Am    Bm     Em   Bm    A   Bm   C  F G ???

Can't let [D]go,  
and it [Gm]doesn't matter how I [D]try.  
I [A]gave it all  
so [G]easily; to [A]you, my love,  
to [G]dreams that never will come [Em7]true.  
Am I [G]strong   enough to see it [Em7]through?  
Go [G]crazy is just what I'll [A11]do.
