[C#maj7, Bb/C]
Oh, [Fmaj7]girl, I've known you very well. I've seen you growing everyday. 
I [Bb/C]never really looked before but now you take my breath away. 

[Fmaj7]Suddenly you're in my life, part of everything I do. 
You [Bb/C]got me working day and night just trying to keep a hold on you. 

[Ab]Here in your [Bb]arms I found my [Ebmaj7]paradise, [Cm]
[Ab]my only [Bb]chance for [Gm]happiness. 
[Ab]And if I [Bb]lose you now I [Ebmaj7]think I would [Cm]die. 

Oh, [C#maj7]say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine, 
we can take forever, [Bb/C]just a minute at a time. 

[chorus]
[C#maj7]More than a woman, [Ab]more than a woman to [Bbm]me. 
[C#maj7]More than a woman, [Ab]more than a woman to [Bbm]me. 
[C#maj7, Bb/C] Oooh 

[Fmaj7]There are stories old and true of people so in love like you and [Bb/C]me. 
And I can see myself, let history repeat itself. 
    
[Fmaj7]Reflecting how I feel for you, thinking about those people,
then [Bb/C]I know that in a thousand years I'd fall in love with you again. 

[Ab]This is the [Bb]only way that [Ebmaj7]we should [Cm]fly, 
[Ab]this is the [Bb]only way to [Gm]go,
[Ab]and if I [B]lose your love I [Ebmaj7]know I would [Cm]die. 

Oh, [C#maj7]say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine, 
we can take forever, [Bb/C]just a minute at a time. 
[chorus]
