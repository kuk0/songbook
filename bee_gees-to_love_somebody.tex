There's a [A]light
[Bm]A certain kind of light
[D]That never shone on [A]me
[G]I want my life to [A]be
To live with [E]you
To live with [D]you

There's a [A]way
[Bm]Everybody says
[D]To do each and every little [A]thing
[G]But what does it [A]bring
If I ain't got [E]you
[D]Ain't got... baby

chorus:
[A]You don't know what it's [E]like
Baby, [D]you don't know what it's [A]like [N.C.]
To love some[E]body
To love some[D]body
The way I [A]love you

Mmm, in my [A]brain
[Bm]I see your face again
[D]I know my frame of [A]mind
[G]You ain't got to be so [A]blind
And I'm [E]blind, so so so very [D]blind

I'm a [A]man, [Bm]can't you see what I am
[D]I live and I breathe for [A]you
[G]But what good does it [A]do
If I ain't got [E]you [D]Ain't got... baby

[chorus]
