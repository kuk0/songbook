intro: [Fm, D#m, Bbm, (2x)]

[Fm]Autumn [D#m]leaves[Bbm]
Beauty's got a [Fm]hold [D#m]on me[Bbm]
[Fm]Autumn [D#m]leaves[Bbm]
Pretty as [Cm]can be

Everybody knows this [Bbm]time
Shadows are [D#]drifting in [Cm]silence
Where [F]lost can't be [Bbm]found
[Cm]Everybody knows this [Bbm]time[D#]

[G#7+]You'll get by
[C#7+]Move it on and [G#7+]let fate decide[C#7+]
And those water-coloured [G#7+]memories
[C#7+]Soft as a [Cm]summer's breeze
[Bbm]You're as pretty as can be

[Fm, Cm, D#m, Bbm (4x)]

[Cm]Knowing now you'll never [Bbm]fake it
Whether my [D#]oceans di[Cm]vide
I'll [F]try to under[Bbm]stand this
But [Cm]everybody knows this [Bbm]time[D#]

[Fm]Autumn [D#m]leaves[Bbm]
Beauty's got a [Fm]hold [D#m]on me[Bbm]
[Fm]Autumn [D#m]leaves[Bbm]
Pretty as [Cm]can be
[Bbm]Everyone [Cm]can see
[Bbm]   Everyone ex[Fm]cept me[Cm] [D#m] [Bbm]

[Fm, Cm, D#m, Bbm]
