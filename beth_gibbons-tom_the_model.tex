[Bm]How can I forget your [Em]tender smile
Moments that I have [Bm]shared with you
[Dm]Our hearts may break
But they're [C]on their way
[D6]And there's nothing I can [Bm]do[A] Ohh...

[chorus:]
So [Bm7]do what you're [A]gotta [Em7]do
And don't misunder[Bm,A]stand [Em]me
You [Bm7]know you don't [A]ever have to [Em7]worry 'bout me
[Bm] I'd [A]do it [Em]again

[BmMaj7] I can understand that it can't be
[Bm] Guess it's hard as you were meant for me
[Dm] But I can't hide my own despair
[Bm] I guess I never [A]will Ohh...

[chorus]

[F] So tired of life
[C] No fairytale
[Dm] So hold your fire
[Bm]'Cause I need [A]you Ohh...

[chorus]
