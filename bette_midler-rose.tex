Some say love, it is a river,
      F            G    C
That drowns the tender reed
(Stay on C Chord)       G
Some say love, it is a razor,
      F            G       C
That leaves your soul to bleed
          Em           Am
Some say love it is a hunger,
      F             G
An endless acheing need
       C             G
I say love it is a flower and
 F        G    C
You its only seed

           C                 G
It's the heart afraid of breaking
      F       G        C
That never learns to dance
          (C)               G
It's the dream afraid of waking
     F        G       C
That never takes a chance
         Em                 Am
It's the one, who won't be taken
      F             G
Who cannot seem to give
        C                G
And the soul afraid of dying
 F           G         C
That never learns to live

          C                   G
When the night has been too lonely
         F        G         C
And the road has been too long
         (C)               G
And you feel that love is only
         F      G        C
For the lucky and the strong
      Em              Am
Just remember in the winter
        F              G-Gsus4
Far beneath the bitter snow
          C                  G
Lies the seed that with the sun's love,
         F        G         C
In the spring becomes the rose
