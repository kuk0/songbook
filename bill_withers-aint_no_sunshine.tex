[Am, Em, G, Am]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone    
It's not warm when she's away   
Ain't no sunshine when she's [Em7]gone  
And she's always gone too [Dm7]long anytime   
[Am, Em, G, Am]
She goes away   
  
Wonder this time where she's gone   
Wonder if she's gone to stay   
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't a home   
Anytime she goes away   

[Am]
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know   
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know   
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know   
I know, I know I know, I know, I know   
Hey I ought to leave the young thing alone   
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone   
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone   
Only darkness everyday   
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home   
Anytime she goes away   
Anytime she goes away   
Anytime she goes away   
Anytime she goes away
