intro: [F, C, Bb, C]

[F]Raindrops keep falling on my [Fmaj7]head
and [F7]just like the guy whose feet are [Bb]too big for his [Am]bed,
[D7]nothing seems to [Am]fit, [D7]Those [Gm7]raindrops are fallin'
on my head they keep fallin'

[C7]So I just [F]did me some talkin' to the [Fmaj7]sun,
and [F7]I said I didn't like the [Bb]way he got things [Am]done
[D7]Sleepin' on the [Am]job, [D7]Those [Gm7]raindrops are fallin'
on my head they keep fallin'

[C7]But there's one [F]thing I [Fmaj7]know,
the [Bb]blues they send to [C]meet me, won't [Am]defeat me
It won't be long till [D7]happiness steps [Gm7]up to greet me
[Bb, C, Bb, C]

[F]Raindrops keep fallin' on my [Fmaj7]head,
but [F7]that doesn't mean my eyes will [Bb]soon be turnin' [Am]red,
[D7]Cryin's not for [Am]me, [D7]cause [Gm7]I'm never gonna stop
the rain by complainin'
[C7]because I'm [F]free, [C7]nothings worryin' me

[F, Fmaj7, Bb, C, Am]

It won't be long till [D7]happiness steps [Gm7]up to greet me
[Bb, C, Bb, C]
