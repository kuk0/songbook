Em           D                      Em
I'm walkin'  through streets that are dead.
Walkin', walkin' with you in my head.
D                   B                 A                        Em
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weepin'.

Did I hear someone tell a lie.
Did I hear someone's distant cry.
I spoke like a child, you just struck me with a smile, while I was sleepin'.
G  A                   G A
     I'm sick of love,
                                Em      G  A
And I'm in the thick of it.
                                G  A
This kind of love,
                Em
I'm so sick of it.

I see I see lovers in the meadow.
I see I see sillouettes in the window.
I watched them 'till they're gone, and they leave me hangin' on,
To a shadow.

I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick.
This kind of love, I'm lovesick.

Sometimes The silence can be like - thunder.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and - plunder.
Could you ever be true, I think of you,
And I wonder.

I'm sick of love,
I wish I never met you.
I'm sick of love,
I'm tryin' to forget you.
Em                          D                      C
Just don't know what to do, I'd give anything to
B        Em
Be with you.
