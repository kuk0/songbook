[F|A, Am|C#m] nx

I was [F|A]bruised and battered I couldn't tell what I felt
I was [Am|C#m]unrecognizable to myself
saw my [F|A]reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
oh brother [Am|C#m]are you gonna leave me wasting like this on the
streets of [Bb|D]Philadelphia [F/A|A, C|E]

I walked the [F|A]avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard [Am|C#m]voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I [F|A]hear the blood in my veins
just as [Am|C#m]black and whispery as the rain on the
streets of [Bb|D]Philadelphia [F/A|A, C|E]

                        
[Bb|D]Ain't no angel gonna [Dm|F#m]greet me
[Bb|D]It's just you and I my [F|A]friend
[Am|C#m]and my clothes don't [Bb|D]fit me no more [C|E] I walked a
thousand miles just to slip this skin

[F|A]The night is falling, I'm lying awake
I can [Am|C#m]feel my self fading away
so [F|A]receive me brother with your fateless kiss or
will we [Am|C#m]leave each other alone like this on the
streets of [Bb|D]Philadelphia [F/A|A, C|E]
