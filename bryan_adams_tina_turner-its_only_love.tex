C                        Dm
You can live without the aggravation
Bb
Ya gotta wanna win - ya gotta wanna win
C                        Dm
You keep lookin' back in desperation
Bb
Over and over and over again

that it's only love
Ya - that's all
Ya it ain't easy baby
But it's only love - and that's all
