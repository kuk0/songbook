[Am, G, Em7, F]

[Am]On a cobweb [G]afternoon
[Em7]In a room full of [F]emptiness
By a freeway I confess
I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death
Reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Anywhere we want to go

[chorus]
[Am]In your [C]house I [G]long to [Am]be
[Am]Room by [C]room [G]patiently[Am]
I'll [F]wait for you [Am]there
[G]Like a [Am]stone I'll [F]wait for you [Am]there
[E]Alone [E7] (Alone)   (F)


On my deathbed
I will pray
To the gods and the angels
to the pagans or anyone
Who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall
I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised
The wine was bled
And there you led me on

[chorus]

[F]And on I [C]read
[E]Until the day was [F]done
And I [Fm]sat in [Dm]regret
Of [E]all the things I've [Am]done
For [F]all that I've [C]blessed
And [E]all that I've [F]wronged
In [Fm]dreams until my [Dm7]death
I will [E]wander on

[chorus]
