Once    there was this kid who
F           C            Ab               C         (He played A G, not Ab)
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
    F               G    C
But when he finally came back
G   C    F               C          G
His hair had turned from black into bright white
   Ab               C        
He said that it was from when
    G#               C/F**     F       (Note the weird chord: it's like this

Am   G                C    
Then   there was this girl who
F              C               Ab           C          (He played G; not Ab 
Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
    F    C              G    C  
But when   they finally made her
G    C    F                C        G
They saw    birthmarks all over her body
    Ab               C
She couldn't quite explain it
       Ab          C/F**  F
They'd always just been   there

One kid had it worse than that

       Am   G             C
'Cause then   there was a boy whose
F                C                 Ab           C        (Again, he plays G
Parents made him come right home directly after school
    F    C            G     C
And when they went to their church
G    C     F                 C        G
They shook   and lurched all over the church floor
   Ab               C
He couldn't quite explain it
       Ab          C/F**  F
They'd always just gone   there
