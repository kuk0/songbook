\begin{verbatim}
[C]Someone told me long ago
 There's a calm before the storm, I [G]know
And it's been coming [C]for some time

 When it's over, so they say
 It'll rain a sunny day, I know
Shining down like water

[chorus:]
[F]I wanna [G]know
Have you [C]ever [C/B]seen the [Am]rain[C/G]
[F]I wanna [G]know
Have you [C]ever [C/B]seen the [Am]rain[C/G]
[F]Coming [G]down on a sunny [C]day

[C,G]
Yesterday and days before
CSun is cold and rain is hard, I know
Been that way for all my time

'Til forever on it goes
Thru the circle fast and slow, I know
And it can't stop, I wonder

[chorus 2x]
