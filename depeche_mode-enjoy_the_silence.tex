Intro: [Bm] [Dm]

[Bm]Words like violence
[Dm]Break the silence
[G]Come crashing in
[G]Into my little world

[Bm]Painful to me
[Dm]Pierce right through me
[G]Can't you understand
[G]Oh my little girl

[Em]All I ever wanted, [G]all I ever needed
Is [Bm]here in [A]my arms
[Em]Words are very [G]unnecessary
[Bm]They can only do [Bb]harm

[Bm] [Dm]

[Bm]Vows are spoken
[Dm]To be broken
[G]Feelings are intense
[G]Words are trivial

[Bm]Pleasures remain
[Dm]So does the pain
[G]Words are meaningless
[G]And forgettable

[Em]All I ever wanted, [G]all I ever needed
Is [Bm]here in [A]my arms
[Em]Words are very [G]unnecessary
[Bm]They can only do [Bb]harm
