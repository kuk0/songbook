\begin{verbatim}
[Am]I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
I'll [Em]tell you that 
but if [Am]I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it 
[Em]where's the sense in that? 

I promise [G]I'm not trying to make your life harder 
or re[Dm]turn to where we were [Em]

[F] but I will go down with this_[C]__ ship
and I won't [Dm]put my hands up and sur[Am]render 
there will be [F]no white flag above my_[C]__ door 
I'm in [G]love and always [Dm] will be 


[Am]I know I left too much mess 
and destruction to come [Em]back again 
and I cause [Am]nothing but trouble 
I understand if you can't [Em]talk to me again 

[G]  and if you live by the rules of it's over 
then I'm [Dm]sure that that makes sense [Em]

[F] but I will go down with this_[C]__ ship
and I won't [Dm]put my hands up and sur[Am]render 
there will be [F]no white flag above my_[C]__ door 
I'm in [G]love and always [Dm] will be 

and when we [C]meet, which I'm sure we will 
all that was [Em]then, will be there still 
I'll let it [Dm]pass, and hold my tongue 
and you will [G]think that I've moved on____

[F] I will go down with this_[C]__ ship
and I won't [Dm]put my hands up and sur[Am]render 
there will be [F]no white flag above my_[C]__ door 
I'm in [G]love and always [Dm] will be 

[F] I will go down with this_[C]__ ship
and I won't [Dm]put my hands up and sur[Am]render 
there will be [F]no white flag above my_[C]__ door 
I'm in [G]love and always [Dm] will be
