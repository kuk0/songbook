[chorus:]
Jo[Dm]lene, jo[F]lene, jo[C]lene, jo[Dm]lene
I'm [C]begging of you please don't take my [Dm]man
Jo[Dm]lene, jo[F]lene, jo[C]lene, jo[Dm]lene
[C]Please don't take him just because you [Dm]can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, jolene

[chorus]

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
Hes the only one for me, jolene

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, jolene

[chorus]
