[A]I can't remember what is wrong
[D]I've been happy now for way too long
and [Bm]oh,[C#m] [F#m]we got
a [C#m]lot more to [F#m]go [E]
[A]I put a trash can by the road
[D]and filled it up just to lighten my load
but [Bm]oh,[C#m] [F#m]I got no[C#m]where to [F#m]go [E]

chorus:
[Bm]someone a[C#m]lone fell a[F#m]sleep by the [Bm]phone
[D]waiting like a [C#m]dog for a [F#m]bone
[Bm]how can it [C#m]be that a [F#m]fish in the [Bm]sea
[D]could feel like it's [C#m]completely a[F#m]lone?
[E]the world may never [F#m]know
the [E]world may never [A]know

[A]I know it hurt you, 'cause you cried
[D]I know it killed you, but nobody died
and [Bm]oh,[C#m] [F#m]the city
ain't [C#m]nothin but [F#m]show [E]
[A]I found a needle in the hay
[D]I found the sunshine at the end of the day
and [Bm]oh,[C#m] [F#m]I found a [C#m]pearl in the [F#m]snow [E]
