[Bm]On a dark desert highway, [F#]cool wind in my hair
[A]Warm smell of colitas, [E]rising up through the air
[G]Up ahead in the distance, [D]I saw a shimmering light
[Em]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[F#]I had to stop for the night

[Bm]There she stood in the doorway;
[F#]I heard the mission bell
[A]And I was thinking to myself,
'this could be [E]heaven or this could be hell'
[G]Then she lit up a candle [D]and she showed me the way
[Em]There were voices down the corridor,
[F#]I thought I heard them say...

[G]Welcome to the hotel cali[D]fornia
Such a [Em]lovely place
Such a [Bm7]lovely face
[G]Plenty of room at the hotel cali[D]fornia
[Em]Any time of year, you can [F#]find it here

[Bm]Her mind is tiffany-twisted, [F#]she got the mercedes bends
[A]She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, [E]that she calls friends
[G]How they dance in the courtyard, [D]sweet summer sweat.
[Em]Some dance to remember, [F#]some dance to forget

[Bm]So I called up the captain,
[F#]'please bring me my wine'
He said, [A]'we haven't had that spirit here
since [E]nineteen sixty nine'
[G]And still those voices are calling from [D]far away,
[Em]Wake you up in the middle of the night
[F#]Just to hear them say...


[G]Welcome to the hotel cali[D]fornia
Such a [Em]lovely place
Such a [Bm7]lovely face
[G]They livin' it up at the hotel cali[D]fornia
[Em]What a nice surprise, bring your [F#]alibis

[Bm]Mirrors on the ceiling,
[F#]The pink champagne on ice
And she said [A]'we are all just prisoners here,
[E]of our own device'
[G]And in the master's chambers,
[D]They gathered for the feast
[Em]The stab it with their steely knives,
[F#]But they just can't kill the beast

[Bm]Last thing I remember, I was
[F#]Running for the door
[A]I had to find the passage back
To the [E]place I was before
[G]'relax,' said the night man,
[D]We are programmed to receive.
[Em]You can checkout any time you like,
[F#]But you can never leave!
