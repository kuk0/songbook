\begin{verbatim}
[G]on bended knee is no [Bm]way to be free
[G7]lifting up an empty cup, i [C/E]ask silently
[C]all my destinations will [G]accept the one that's me
[D]so i can breathe...[Dsus2, D, Dsus4, D5]

[G]circles they grow and they [Bm]swallow people whole
[G7]half their lives they say goodnight
to [C/E]wives they'll never know
[C]a mind full of questions, and a [G]teacher in my soul
[D]and so it goes...[Dsus2, D, Dsus4, D5]

[G]don't come closer or [Bm]i'll have to go
[G7]holding me like gravity are [C/E]places that pull
[C]if ever there was someone to [G]keep me at home
[D]it would be you...[Dsus2, D, Dsus4, D5]

[G]everyone i come across, in [Bm]cages they bought
[G7]they think of me and my wandering,
but i'm [C/E]never what they thought
[C]i've got my indignation, but i'm [G]pure in all my thoughts
[D]i'm alive...[Dsus2, D, Dsus4, D5]

[G]wind in my hair, i feel [Bm]part of everywhere
[G7]underneath my being is a [C/E]road that disappeared
[C]late at night i hear the trees,
they're [G]singing with the dead
[D]overhead...[Dsus2, D, Dsus4, D5]

[G]leave it to me as i [Bm]find a way to be
[G7]consider me a satellite, [C/E]forever orbiting
[C]i knew all the rules, but the [G]rules did not know me
[D]guaranteed [Dsus2, D, Dsus4, D5]
