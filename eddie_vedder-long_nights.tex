Intro:   Gm

Gm                         F
Have no fear For when I'm alone
                                C
I'll be better off than I was before

I've got this light I'll be around to grow
Who I was before I cannot recall

Chorus:
Bb              Am             Dm
Long nights allow me to feel...
                G7
I'm falling...I am falling
Bb               Am
The lights go out
Dm
Let me feel...I'm falling
G7            Bb                 Am          Dm (see Rhy Fig 1)
I am falling safely to... the ground...Ah

I'll take this soul that's inside me now
Like a brand new friend I'll forever know

I've got this light And the will to show
I will always be better than before

Chorus
