[Gb]                  [Db]         [Gb]     [B]
Through the sleepless nights I cry for you
           [E]     [Bb]        [Ebm]          [D]
And wonder who             Is kissing you
       [Gb]                [Db]               [Gb]       [Gb]
These sleepless nights Will break my heart in two

[Gb]                   [Db]        [Gb]       [B]
Somehow, through the days I don't give in
        [E]       [Bb]         [Ebm]        [D]
I hide the tears         That wait within
[Gb]                  [Db]          [Gb]         [Gb][A]
But then through sleepless nights I cry again

chorus:
[D]        [A]    [D]     [Gb]
Why did you go? Why did you go?
     [Ebm]            [Gb]         [Bb]    [Db][Db7]
Don't you know, don't you know I need you?

Verse:
I keep hoping you'll come back to me Oh let it be, please let it be
My love, please end these  Sleepless nights for me

Chorus:
Why did you go? Why did you go?
Don't you know, don't you know  I need you?

Verse:
I keep hoping you'll come back to me Oh let it be, please let it be
My love, please end these Sleepless nights for me
My love, please end these Sleepless nights for me
