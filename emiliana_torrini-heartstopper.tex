Here the F is like 003210

C        G
You said I began
     Am             F
This messy state of love affair 
      C                  G
And I drink too much and smoke too fast 
         Am                F
And this city's cleared my innocence 

C                 G
Coffee is pouring out my ears 
         Am              F
It's the only thing they have in here
       C                    G Am F 
And my heart stops beating 

C           G
And when it stops it stops 
Am F
My heart stopped beating 
C           G
And when it stops it stops 
Am F
My heart stopped beating 

Number three still on my plate 
I heard the trains are running late 
And I laugh out loud My life is a mess 
I have gone too far In my lifelessness 

Another coffee it's on the house 
The poor girl look is on the owners spouse 
And my heart stopped beating 

And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating 
And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating 

Outside your house To make a scene 
In my head you grabbed me passionately 
But the lights are out And in an hour
I walked on home In the pouring shower 
Lost my keys in front of me 
My neighbor's smile he's handing me 
The blackest coffee you will ever see 

And my hearts stopped beating 

And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating 
And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating
