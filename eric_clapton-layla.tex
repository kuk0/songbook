  What will you do when you get lonely, 
Dm            Eb              F    F7Bb      
  with nobody waiting by your side?    You've
     C           F               Bb    Gm7   
been running and hiding much too long.    You
          C                 F     
know it's just your foolish pride.

   Layla,   you got me on my knees, Layla,  
   B    Db              Ebm        %  Db B Db
    I'm begging darling please, Layla.   Darling
             Ebm             %    Db B Db Am C
   won't you ease my worried mind.        

Dm         %             A      %Dm        
  Tried to give you consolation,   your old
    Eb            F    F7Bb       C      
man won't let you down.    Like a fool, I
F                 Bb   Gm7           C    
fell in love with you,    turned the whole
             F    
world upside down.

  Let's make the best of the situation. 
Dm         Eb           F    F7Bb            
  before I finally go insane.    Please don't
C         F            Bb   Gm7           
say we'll never find a way,    and tell me
C                F    
all my love's in vain.
