Intro:  Em   A7 (x4)

Em         A7
I'm gonna make a mistake- 
Em        A7
I'm gonna do it on purpose 
C7      F7           Em
I'm gonna waste my time 
Em       A7
'cause I'm full as a tick 
Em       A7
And I'm scratching at the surface 
C7          F7       Em   B7
And what I find is mine 

Gm  Eb               Gm       Eb
And when the day is done, and I look back 
                Cm      F7  
And the fact is I had fun, fumbling around 
Gm Eb             Gm           Eb
All the advice I shunned, and I ran 
                           Cm         F7
Where they told me not to run, but I sure had fun, so 

Em         A7
I'm gonna fuck it up again 
Em        A7
I'm gonna do another detour 
C7 F7           Em
Unpave my path 

Em          A7
And if you wanna make sense 
Em       A7
Whatcha looking at me for 
C7      F7       Em   B7
I'm no good at math 
Gm  Eb             Gm
And when I find my way back, 
     Eb            Cm        F7
The fact is I just may stay, or I may not 
Gm  Eb             Gm
I've acquired quite a taste 
Eb                  Cm
For a well-made mistake 
                   F7
I wanna mistake why can't I make a mistake? 

Bridge: Em, A7, Em, A7, G, D

Em Eb  G                                   
I'm always doing what I think I should 
Em Eb   G                               
Almost always doing everybody good 
Em Eb   G   C   Bb7  B7

Gm    Eb          Gm
Do I wanna do right, of course but 
      Eb          Cm
Do I really wanna feel I'm forced to 
F7                Gm
Answer you, hell no 
Eb                     Gm
I've acquired quite a taste 
   Eb               Cm        
For a well-made mistake, I wanna 
           F7               
Make a mistake, why can't I make a mistake
