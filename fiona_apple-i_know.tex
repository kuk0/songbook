[C]So [Fm]be it I'm your crowbar
[C]If that's what [Fm]I am so far
[C]Until you [Am]get [G]out of this [C]mess
[C]And I will [Fm]pretend
[C]That I don't know [Fm]of your sins
[C]Until you are [Am]ready [G]to con[F]fess
But all the [Dm]time, [Fm]all the [D]time
[C]I'll know[F], [C]I'll know[F]

[C]And you can [Fm]use my skin
[C]To bury [Fm]secrets in
[C]And I [Am]will [G]settle you [C]down
[C]And at my [Fm]own sugges[C]tion
I will [Fm]ask no questions
[C]While I do my thing[A] in the[G] back[F]ground
But all the [Dm]time, [Fm]all the [D]time
[C]I'll know[F], [C]I'll know[F]

[E, Am]
[E]Baby -- I can't help you [Am]out
While [F]she's still [C]around

[C]So for the [Fm]time being[C]
I'm[Fm] being[C] pa[Am,G]tient[C]
[C]And amidst this [Fm]bitterness
[C]If you'll just con[Fm]sider this
[C]Even[Am] if it [G]don't make [F]sense
[Dm]All the time[Fm], [D]give it time
And [C]when the [Fm]crowd becomes your [C]burden
And [Fm]you've early closed your [C]curtain
I'll [Am]wait by the [G]backstage [C]door
[C]While you [Fm]try to find[C]
The [Fm]lines to speak your mind[C]
And pry it open [Am]hoping [G]for an [F]encore
And if it [Dm]gets too late[Fm] for [D]me to wait
For [C]you to find you [E]love me, and [C]tell me so
[Am]It's [D]ok, [F]don't [G]need to say it...
