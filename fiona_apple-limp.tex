You wanna make me sick
You wanna lick my wounds, Don't you, baby?
You want the badge of honor when you save my hide
But you're the one in the way
Of the day of doom, baby
If you need my shame to reclaim your pride

Dm            Am         Dm           Am
   and when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
F             C           Dm
  I never did anything to you, man
                Am
  But no matter what I try
       F                 Dm
You'll beat me with your bitter lies
  (Am)           (Ab)         (G)          F#
So call me crazy, hold me down make me cry; get off now, baby
F             C                   Dm            C    Em  (Am)
  It won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hand

(Riff)
You feed the beast I have within me
You wave the red flag, baby you make it run run run
Standing on the sidelines, waving and grinning
You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun

Dm            Am         Dm           Am
   and when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
F             C           Dm
  I never did anything to you, man
                Am
  But no matter what I try
       F                 Dm
You'll beat me with your bitter lies
  (Am)           (Ab)         (G)          F#
So call me crazy, hold me down make me cry; get off now, baby
F             C                   Dm            C    Em (Am)
  It won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hand
