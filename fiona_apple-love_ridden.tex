verse
Em       F                    C
Love ridden, I've looked at you With the
Em     Ebdim(no 3rd)  C
focus I gave to my birthday candles
G                     F          Em
I've wished on the lidded blue flames Under your
              Eb dim
brow And baby, I wished for you

verse
Em     Ebdim              C
Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed And I wanna
Em         F          C
crawl in with you but I cry instead
G                  F                  Em(7)       C
I want your warm, but it will only make me colder
                   Ebdim
when it's over So I can't tonight, baby

chorus
G        F       Em7
No, not baby anymore If I
G                   F               C
need you I'll just use your simple name
G    D/F#          Em             Eb
Only kisses on the cheek from now on

And in a little while, we'll only have to wave

My hand won't hold you down no more

The path is clear to follow through
F-5                                (bass d-db-c)
I stood too long in the way of the door

Chorus
No, not baby anymore - if I need you
I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on

No, not baby anymore - if I need you
I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave
