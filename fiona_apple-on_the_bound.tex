[Fm7, Fm7/E]
All my life is on me now, hail the pages turning 
And the future's on the bound, hell don't know my fury 

[Fm, Dm7, Fm, Dm9]
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need 
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need 
You're all I need - and maybe some faith would 
Do me good 

I don't know what I'm doing Don't know should I change my mind
I can't decide, there's too many variations to consider
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me more to do 
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself, I make it bitter

Fm             Bbsus4                  Bbm
Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time
Fm(bass F-G-Ab-F) Bbsus4       Bbm (bass Bb-Ab)
Tell me you       belong to me
Fm               Bbsus4       Bbsus4/Ab(no 5th) Bbsus4(no5)/G
Baby say that its all gonna be alright
Bbsus4(no5)/F#    (Fm)
I believe that it isn't.
