I was [E]staring at the [C]sky, just [G]looking for a [B7]star
To [E]pray on, or [C]wish on, or [G]something like [B7]that
I was [E]having a sweet [C]fix of a [G]daydream of a [B7]boy
Whose [F7]reality I [Em]knew, was a [A7]hopeless to be had
But then the [E]dove of [C]hope began its [G]downward [B7]slope
And I [E]believed for a moment that [C]my chances
Were [G]approaching to be [B7]grabbed
But as it [E]came down [C]near, so did a [G]weary [F7]tear
I [Em]thought it was a [A7]bird, but it was [F7]just a paper bag

[chorus]
Hunger [G]hurts, and I [Cmaj7]want him [F7]so bad,
oh it [G]kills because I [G]know that I'm a [Cmaj7]mess
he don't [F7]wanna clean up
I've got to [G]fold because these [Cmaj7]hands are just
too [F7]shaky to [G]hold
Hunger [Em7]hurts, but starving [A7]works,
when it [F7]costs too much to [G]love    [B7]

Verse 2:
[E]And I went [C]crazy again[G] today,
[B7]Looking for a [E]strand to climb,
[C]looking for a [G]little hope[B7, E]
[C]Baby said he [G]couldn't stay,
[B7]wouldn't put his [F7]lips to mine
And a [Em]fail to kiss is a [A7]fail to cope
I said, [E]'Honey, I don't [C]feel so good[G],
don't feel [B7]justified; [E]Come on put a [C]little love
[G]here in my [B7]void,' He said? 'It's [E]all in your[C] head,' 
and I said, 'So's [G]everything,' but he didn't [F7]get it 
I [Em]thought he was a [A7]man But he was [F7]just a little boy
