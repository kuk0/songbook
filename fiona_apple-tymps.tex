[Bbm, G#, F#, Gm, D]

Those boon times [Bbm]went bust my feet of clay,
they [G#]dried to dust
[F#]The red isn't the red we painted
[Gm]It's just [D]rust
[Bbm]And that signature thing 
that used to bring a [G#]following
[F#]I have trouble now, [Gm]even re[D]membering

So [Gm]why did I kiss him so hard
Late [Cm]last friday night
[Gm]And keep on letting him [A#]change all my plans
[D#]I'm either so sick in the head
I [F]need to be bled dry to quit
[Bm]Or I just really used to [C]love him
I sure [Gm]ho[D]pe that's [Gm]it

[Bbm, G#, F#, Gm, D]

I knew that [Bbm]to keep in touch 
would do me [G#]deep in dutch
[F#]'Cause it isn't the rush of remembering,
[Gm]it's just [D]mush
[Bbm]And that signature thing
is only growing [G#]harrowing
[F#]I should have no trouble now
[Gm]to keep from [D]following
