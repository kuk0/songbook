I could liken you to a werewolf, the way you left me for dead
        Am            G            F
But I admit that I provided a full moon
            G
And I could liken you to a shark, the way you bit off my head
          Am         G               F             G
But then again I was waving around a bleeding open wound

F                   Em (022010)
But you were such a super guy
         Am
'Til the second you get away from me
F              D# (6653--)
We were like a wishing well
      D7 (-5453-)
And a bolt of electricity
    F              Am
But we could still support each other
C                  A#
All we gotta do is avoid each other
F                 Em           Dm           Am
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key (x2)

C

A#               D#
The lava of a volcano
A#                         D#
Shot up hot from under the sea
D7                  F#m
One thing leads to another
E
And you made an island of me

G – E – G

            G
And I could liken you to a chemical, the way you made me compound to compound
          Am              G        F
But I'm a chemical too, inevitable you and me would mix
            G
And I could liken you to a lot of things, but I always come around
             Am        G              F                  G
Cause in the end I'm a sensible girl. I know the fiction of the fix

F                   Em (022010)
But you were such a super guy
         Am
'Til the second you get away from me

    F              Am

F                 Em           Dm           Am
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key (x4)
