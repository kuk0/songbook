\begin{verbatim}
[x03550] Dryin' up in conversation, still
My head was halfway round the world [022030]
And workin' through your sleeping I was
Driven by the promise of a quick return

[F]And I wonder if she'll be the very same [022030]
[F]And I wonder if she's gonna break the [A]waves
[x03550]Again...

Tryin' just to focus on the good
I'm tired of divin' for the pearls
And every dawn is another morning less
I have to wait to wake beside that girl
And I hope she's gonna be the very same
And I hope she can survive this wave again

[A]And if we're all for [F]some[A]one
[A]And if we're born for [F]some[A]one
[A]When will she come, that [F]someone?
[A]And put things in their [F]place? [A]

Comin' back to see you girl,
You know there's nothing surer in this world
Remember all the mad and seasons
Back when we weren't old enough to wait our turn
And I hope we'll gonna be the very same
And I hope we can survive this wave again

And if we're all for someone
And if we're both for someone
When will she come, that someone?
And put things in their place?
