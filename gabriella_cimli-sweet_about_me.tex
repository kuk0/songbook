\begin{verbatim}
capo 4th fret
[Am, C, G, Am]
Ooh watching me, hanging by a string this time
Don't easily the climax of a perfect life.
Ooh watching me, hanging by a string this time.
Don't easily smile worth a hundred lies.

[prechorus:]
If there's lessons to be learned,
I'd rather get my jammin' words in first, Lord
Tell ya something that I've found, 
that the worlds a better place when it's upside down, boy
If there's lessons to be learned,
I'd rather get my jamming words in first, Lord
When you're playing with desire,
don't come running to my place when it burns like fire

[chorus:]
                Am   C                   G    Am  
( Sweet about ) me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
    Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
    Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
    Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah

Blue, blue, blue waves they crash
As time goes by, so hard to catch
And too, too smooth, ain't all that
Why don't you ride my side of the tracks

[prechorus, chorus]
