[Intro]
[Dm7, F/G, Cmaj7, Fmaj7, Bm7b5=x20231, E, Am]

Dm7           F/G  Cmaj7             Fmaj7
Used to be so easy to give my heart away
Bm7b5                        E   Am   Bmadd4         Am/C     Am
But I've found that the hard way is a price you have to pay
Dm7          F/G  Cmaj7            Fmaj7
I found that love was no friend of mine
Bm7b5               Esus4      E
I should have known time after time

[chorus]
Am Em           Am      Dadd2
So long, it was so long ago
          F7/9          E7#9      Am
But I've still got the blues for you

Used to be so easy to fall in love again
I've found that the hard way, it's a way that leads to pain
I've found that love was more than just a game
To play and to win but to lose just the same

[chorus]

Bm7     E     Am7        Bm7       C
So many years since I've seen your face
Bm7           E                 Fmaj7 Cadd2 Fmaj7
And now in my heart, there's an empty space
            Am
You used to be

[Dm7    F/G    Cmaj7    Fmaj7    Bm7b5    E    Am Bmadd4 Am/C Am
 Dm7    F/G    Cmaj7    Fmaj7    Bm7b5         Esus4     E]

Am Em           Am      Dadd2
So long, it was so long ago
         F7/9          E7#9      Am    Em
But I've still got the blues for you
           Am            Em          Am          Dadd2
Though the days come and go, there's one thing I know
     F7/9          E7#9      Am
I've still got the blues for you
