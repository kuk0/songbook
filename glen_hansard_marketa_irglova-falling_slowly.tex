Intro: C F Am F F
[C]I dont know you [F]but I want you
[C]All the more for [F]that
[C]Words fall through me [F]and always fool me
[C]And I cant [F]react

[Am]Games that [G]never a[F]mount to [G]more than their [Am]worth
Will [G]play themselves [F]out

[chorus]
[C]Take this sinking [F]boat and point it [Am]home
We've still got [F]time
[C]Raise your hopeful [F]voice you have a [Am]choice
You've made it [F]known

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I cant go back
Moods that take me and erase me
And i'm painted black

[Am]You have [G]suffered e[F]nough and [G]warred with your[Am]self
It's [G]time that you [F]won

[chorus]
[Am, G, F, G, Am, G, F]

[C]Take this sinking [F]boat and point it [Am]home
We've still got [F]time
[C]Raise your hopeful [F]voice you have a [Am]choice
You've made it [F]known
[C]Falling slowly, [F]sing your melo[Am]dy
I'll sing it [F]loud
