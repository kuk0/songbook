intro: [Em, G, C, G (x2)]

Some[Em]times, [G]I [C]feel, I've [G]got to;
[Em] [G]Run a[C]way, I've [G]got to;
[Em] [G]Get a[C]way, From the [G]pain you
[Em]drive in[G]to the [C]heart of [G]me.

The [Em]love [G]we [C]share, [G]seems to,
[Em] [G]Go no[C]where. [G] And I've
[Em]lost [G]my [C]light, [G]For I
[Em]toss and turn; I can'[G]t sleep at night.

[E]Once I ran to you, [G]now I run from you,
[C]This tainted love you've given,
I [Am]give you all a boy could give you.
[Am]Take my tears and that's not nearly...
[Em]All, [G]Tainted [C]love, [G]oh, oh, [Em]oh,
[G]Tainted [C]love.[G]

[Em] Now [G]I [C]know, I've [G]got to;
[Em] [G]Run a[C]way, I've [G]got to;
[Em] [G]Get a[C]way, [G]you don't
[Em]really want any [G]more from me.

To [Em]make [G]things [C]right,
[G]You need some[Em]one to [G]hold you [C]tight.
[G]And you [Em]think [G]love is to [C]pray,
[G] But I'm [Em]sorry, I don't [G]pray that way.

[E]Once I ran to you, [G]now I run from you,
[C]This tainted love you've given,
I [Am]give you all a boy could give you.
[Am]Take my tears and that's not nearly...
[Em]All, [G]Tainted [C]love, [G]oh, oh, [Em]oh,
[G]Tainted [C]love.[G]

Don't [Em]touch [G]me, [C]please,
I [G]cannot [Em]stand the [G]way you [C]tease.[G]
I [Em]love you, [G]though you [C]hurt me [G]so,
[Em]Now I'm going to pack my [G]things and go.

Coda:
[Em] [G]Tainted [C]love, [G]oh, oh, [Em]oh,
[G]Tainted [C]love, [G]oh, oh, [Em]oh,

[G]Touch me, baby, [C]tainted [G]love,[Em]
[G]Touch me, baby, [C]tainted [G]love,[Em]

[G]Tainted [C]love, [G]oh, oh, [Em]oh,
[G]Tainted [C]love, [G]oh, oh, [Em]oh...
