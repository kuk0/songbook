I remember when
I remember I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space

And when you're out there Without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Mmm! Does that make me crazy? [3x]
possibly/probably

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice

Mmmm Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy [3x]
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I wanna be like them

Mhmmmm Ever since I was little,
ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy Probably Ooh ooh
