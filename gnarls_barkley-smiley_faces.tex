But what did you [B]do?
What did you [Bm]say?
Did you [A]walk or did you run away?
Where are you now?
Where have you been?
Did you come alone or did you bring a friend?

I need to know this cause I noticed you're smiling
Out in the sun, having fun and feeling free
And I can [Em]tell you know how hard this life can [F#m]be
But you keep on smiling for [Em]me[F#m]

What went right?
What went wrong?
Was it a story or was it a song?
Was it overnight or did it take you long?
Was knowing your weakness what made you strong?

Or all the above, oh how I love to see you smiling
And oh yeah, take just a little pain just in case
[Em]You need something warm to embrace
To help you put on a smiling face

Dont you go off into the new day with any doubt
Here's a summary of something that you could smile about
Say for instance my girlfiend, she bugs me all the time
But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time

I want to leap whenever I see you smiling
Because its easily one of the hardest things to do
Your worries and fears become your friends
And they end up smiling at you

Put on a smiley face
