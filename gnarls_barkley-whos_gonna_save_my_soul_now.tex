\begin{verbatim}
[Fm]Got some bad news this [Cm]morning
Which in turn made my day
When this someone spoke I listened
All of a sudden has less and less to say
[Ebm]Oooo how could this [C#]be
All this time I've lived vicariously

[Bbm]Who's gonna save my [Fm]soul now
Who's gonna save my soul now
[Ebm]How will my story ever be [Bbm]told now
How will my story be told now

Made me feel like somebody; Like somebody else
Although he was imitated often
It felt like I was being myself
Is it a shame that someone else's song
Was totally and completely depended on

Who's gonna save my soul now
Who's gonna save my soul now
I wonder if I'll live grow old now
Getting high cause I feel so low down

And maybe it's a little selfish
All I have is the memory
Yet I never stopped to wonder
Was it possible you hurtin' worse than me
Still my hunger turns to greed
Cause what about what I need And Ooooo

Who's gonna save my soul now
Whooooo's gonna save my soul now
Oooo I know I'm out of control now hoohooo
Tired enough to lay my own soul down
