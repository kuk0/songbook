Intro: Bm-Bsus2-G

	D	Em	   G
And I'd give up forever to touch you
	 Bm	       A           G
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
	   D	      Em	  G
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
      Bm	    A		  G
And I don't want to go home right now

    D	      Em	    G
And all I can taste is this moment
    Bm	      A		      G
And all I can breathe is your life
    D	      Em	 G
And sooner or later it's over
       Bm	     A	      G
I just don't want to miss you tonight

chorus:
      Bm	     A	      G
And I don't want the world to see me
	 Bm		  A	 G
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     Bm		  A	     G
When everything's made to be broken
       Bm	   A	      G
I just want you to know who I am

	D		Em		 G
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
       Bm	 A	       G
Or the moment of truth in your lies
     D	        Em	       G
When everything feels like the movies
	  Bm		A	    G
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive
