What is Love?    Baby, Don't hurt me.

Don't Hurt me, No more.

Oh, I don't know why you're not there 
I give you my love, but you don't care 
So what is right and what is wrong 
Gimme a sign 

chorus
Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh 
Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh 

Oh, I don't know, what can I do 
What else can I say, it's up to you 
I know we're one, just me and you 
I can't go on 

chorus
Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh 
Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh 

What is love, oooh, oooh, oooh 
What is love, oooh, oooh, oooh 

chorus
I want no other, no other lover 
This is your life, our time 
When we are together, I need you forever 
Is it love
