Verse 1:
   G           F
Oh life can be strange
         G         F
Good and bad in so many ways
       G             G/F#
And in time you will find
     G/E                             A7   D
That things are not always what they seem

Verse 2:
Well I've got something to say
But you might laugh, joke or run away
Cause I'm awkward and nervous
Sometimes I don't say much at all

Chorus:
           C
But if the rain must fall
     Em
If I lose it all
       F#          F#7      B        B/A
If the world comes down and takes my soul
       C
If the sky turns black
           Em
And theres no way back
         F#             F#7
It won't matter much to me
         B   B/A
If I had you
C         G
All I need is your love
              Am
That's all I need
          Em            D
All I need is your love

Verse 3:
        G             F
Oh well dreams can come true
              G               F
If you know inside you really want them to 
           G           G/F#
Or you can sit you can wait
        G/E                       A7            D
You can leave your fate in someone else's hands

Verse 4:
Oh but I, I want you
And nothing else can make me feel the way you do
So I'm waiting, I'm wishing
That it's me you'll be holding tonight and every night

Chorus:
           C
But if the rain must fall
     Em
If I lose it all
       F#          F#7      B          B/A
If the world comes down and takes my soul
       C
If the sky turns black
          Em
If theres no way back
         F#             F#7
It won't matter much to me
         B   B/A
If I had you
C             G
All I need is your love
   Am
Ooooh

All I need is your love, your love

all I need is your love
    Am

            Em           D
And nothing else nothing else will ever do
Am                    Em Em-Fm-F#-G
it's all I need is you

Chorus:
       C
If the rain must fall
     Em
If I lose it all
       F#          F#7      B          B/A
If the world comes down and takes my soul
       C
If the sky turns black
          Em
If theres no, no way back
         F#             F#7
It won't matter much to me
         B   B/A  Gadd6  F#*
If I had you  Oooh Yeah
