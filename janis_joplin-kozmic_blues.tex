[Am, Am/G, Am/F#, F]
[Am], [Am/G], [Am/F#], [F]
Time keeps movin' on,
Friends they turn away.
[F] I keep movin' [G]on
 But I [F]never found out [G]why
I keep [Am]pushing so hard the dream,
I keep tryin' to make it right
Through [E]another lonely day, whoaa. 
 
[Am], [Am/G], [Am/F#], [F]
Dawn has come at last,
Twenty-five years, honey just in one night, oh yeah.
[F] Well, I'm twenty-five years [G]older now
[F] So I know we can't be [G]right
And I'm no [Am]better, baby,
And I can't help you no more
Than I did when [E]just a girl.

[chorus:]
[A] Aww, but it don't make no [Bm]difference, baby, no, no, 
[D] And I know that I could [A]always try. 
[A] It don't make no [Bm]difference, baby, yeah,
[D] I better hold it now,
[D] I better need it, yeah,
[D] I better use it till the [D]day [C#m]I [A]die, whoa.

[Am], [Am/G], [Am/F#], [F]
Don't expect any answers, dear,
For I know that they don't come with age, no, no.
[F] Well, ain't never gonna love you any [G]better, babe.
And I'm [F]never gonna love you [G]right,
So you'd better [Am]take it now, right now.
[chorus]
