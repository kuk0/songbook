[F#]One pill makes you larger
and [G]one pill makes you small
and the [F#]ones that mother gives you
[G]don't do anything at all
go ask [A]Alice [C]when she's [D]ten feet [A]tall

And if you [F#]go chasing rabbits
and you [G]know you're going to fall
Tell'em a [F#]hooka smoking caterpillar
has [G]given you the cord
Call [A]Alice [C]when [D]she was just [A]small

[E]When men on the chessboard 
get up and [A]tell you where to go
and you [E]just had some kind of mushroom
and your [A]mind is moving low
go ask [F#]Alice, I think she'll know
When logic and proportion have [G]fallen sloppy dead
and the [F#]white knight is talking backwards
and the [G]red queen's off with her head
Re[A]member [C]what the [D]Dormouse [A]said
[E]Feed your [A]head! [E]Feed your [A]head!
[E]Feed your [A]head!
