\begin{verbatim}
C      D      Am         C      D       Am
I hurt myself today   to see if I still feel
C       D      Am         C       D        Am
I focus on the pain   the only thing that's real
C        D        Am          C      D      Am
The needle tears a hole   the old familiar sting
     C       D      Am           C       D       G          
Try to kill it all away   but I remember everything

Am          F             C        G
What have I become?   My sweetest friend
Am          F           C          G
Everyone I know   goes away in the end
Am                     F         C       G
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
Am              F             C        G
I will let you down   I will make you hurt

C           D        Am         C      D     Am
I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liars chair
C          D        Am    C     D     Am
Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair
C           D         Am         C       D      Am
Beneath the stains of time   the feeling disappears
C         D      Am    C     D     G
You are someone else   I am still right here

[For this last part just strum a G]
If I could start again   A million miles away
I would keep myself   I would find a way
