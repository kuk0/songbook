Em                       D Dsus4 D Dmaj9
When routine bites hard
Bm [Em7-]              A
And ambitions are low
Em                        D Dsus4 D Dmaj9
And resentment rides high
Bm [Em7-]                A
But emotions won't grow
Em                          D Dsus4 D Dmaj9
And we're changing our ways
Bm [Em7-]              A
Taking different roads
Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
Love, love will  tear us    apart again

Why is this bedroom so cold?
You turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Am I feeling surprised?
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear it apart again

You cry out in your sleep
All my feelings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth
As despiration takes hold
Yet, that somehing's so good
Just can't function no more, when
Love, love will tear us apart again
