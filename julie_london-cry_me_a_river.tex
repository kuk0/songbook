\begin{verbatim}
A7                 Am7
Now you say you're lonely,
Dm7         G7          C
You cry the whole night through,
E     E7      A7              Am7
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river,
Dm7       E7         Am  E E7
I cried a river over you.

A7                 Am7
Now you say you're sorry,
Dm7       G7     C
For bein' so un..true,
E     E7      A7              Am7
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river,
Dm7       E7         Am
I cried a river over you.

[chorus]
Am7           E7               Dm7       E7
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head,
E     Am        Dm7    E7
while you never shed a tear.
Am7        E   E7     Dm7          E7
Remember...I remember all that you said...
Am7                  Am
told me love was too plebeian,
Am7              Am           Bb7  E7
told me you were through with me...and...

A7              Am7
Now you say you love me,
Dm7           G7        C
Well, just to prove you do,
E    E7     A7              Am7
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river,
Dm7       E7         Am  Dm7 E7..Bb7 E7 Am
I cried a river over you.

[chorus]
[repeat last verse]

Am7       Dm7    E7    Am  Dm7 E7..Bb7 E7 Am
I cried a river..over..you(x3).
