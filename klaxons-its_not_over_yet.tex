i'd live for you
i'd die for you
do what you want me to

i'd cry for you
my tears will show
that i can't let you go

it's not over, not over, not over, not over yet (you still want me, don't you?)   
it's not over, not over, not over, not over yet (cos i can see through you)
it's not over, not over, not over, not over yet (you still want me, don't you?)   
it's not over, not over, not over, not over yet

don't let me down 
don't make a sound
don't throw it all a-way

remember me
so tenderly
don't let it slip a-way
