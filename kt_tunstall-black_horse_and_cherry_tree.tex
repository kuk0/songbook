[Em, Em/G, E, B7, Em]
[n/c] Well my heart knows me better than i know myself,
so im gonna let it do all the talking
[Em, Em/G, E, B7, Em]
[n/c] sent it away to the middle of nowhere,
with a big black horse and a cherry tree
[Em, Em/G, E, B7, Em]
[n/c] fell in fear upon my back, i said dont look back,
just keep on walking
[Em, Em/G, E, B7, Em]
[n/c] but the little ole horse he looked this way and said,
hey lady will you marry me?

[chorus 2x]
i said [Em]no, [D]no, no, [Em]no, no, no
i said [Em]no, [D]no, [c]you're not the one for [Em]me

well my heart had a problem in the early hours,
so i stopped it dead for a beat or two
but i cut some cord and i shouldnt of done that,
and it wont forgive me after all these years
i sent it away to the middle of nowhere,
with a big black horse and a cherry tree
it wont come back cos its oh so happy,
and now ive got a hole for the world to see

[chorus]
[n/c] no, no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, you're not the one for me [2x]
[Em]big black [D]horse and the cherry [Em]tree
[Em]i cant quite [D]get there cos my
[c]hearts forsaken [Em]me yeah yeah yeah [2x]
