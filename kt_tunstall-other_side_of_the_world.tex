intro: D chord, altering index finger

[A]Over the sea and far [G]away
She's waiting like an [A]iceberg
Waiting to [G]change
But she's cold in[A]side
She wants to be [G]like the water

[intro chords]
[A]All the muscles [G]tighten in her [A]face
Buries her [G]soul in one em[A]brace
They're one and the [G]same just like [G]water

chorus:
[D]And the fire fades a[Bm]way
Most of every[G]day
Is full of tired excu[A]ses
But its too hard to [D]say
I wish it were [Bm]simple
But we give up ea[G]sily
You're close e[A]nough to see that
[D]You're [Bm]on the [G]other side of the [A]world to me

[intro chords]
[A]On comes the panic [G]light holding on with [A]fingers
And feelings a[G]like
But the time has [A]come to [G]move along

[chorus]
[Em]Can you help me?
[G]Can you let me [D]go?
[Em]And can you still love me
[G]When you can't [A]see me anymore?
[chorus]
