Intro:
E, G#m7, Gm7, F#m7, B7
                    E
So you think it's funny
                 G#m7                   Gm7  F#m7
That you keep calling me all of the tiiiime
      B7
Everyday
     E
Oh honey
                     G#m7                 Gm7  F#m7     
Don't want to be following and falling behiiiind
                      B7           Am
If you're gonna be walking away
    
And G#m7 don't know
B7                 E
Why G#m7 wouldn't follow
            Am     B7    E
Wouldn't follow


Chorus
                   A
You got me looking up
                      F#m7
Even when G#m7'm falling down
                    C9        B7        E
You got me crawling out of my skin
                      A
You got me wondering why
                     F#m7
G#m7 am underneath this big old sky
   C9          B7           E
Stopping the loving getting in
        
                  E
Now you say it's easy
                 G#m7                  Gm7 F#m7 
That you been falling for all of my charm
             B7                 E
And getting lost in my smile
                  G#m7
Never ceases to amaze me
                     Gm7 F#m7
When G#m7'm chancing my arm
             B7                   Am
That G#m7 still do it with style
           B7
And now G#m7 hope
                    E
You'll be with me tomorrow
            Am       B7     E
With me tomorrow

Chorus                  A
You got me looking up
                      F#m7
Even when G#m7'm falling down
                    C9        B7        E
You got me crawling out of my skin
                      A
You got me wondering why
                     F#m7
G#m7 am underneath this big old sky
   C9          B7           E
Stopping the loving getting in
