[E, G#m7, Gm7, F#m7, B7]

So you think it's [E]funny
That you keep [G#m7]calling me all of the [Gm7,F#m7]time
[B7]Everyday
Oh [E]honey
Don't want to be [G#m7]following and falling [Gm7,F#m7]behind
If you're gonna be [B7]walking away
[Am]And don't [B7]know
Why wouldn't [E]follow
Wouldn't [Am]follow [B7]

Chorus
[E]You got me looking [A]up
Even when i'm falling [F#m7]down
You got me crawling [C9]out of my [B7]skin [E]
You got me wondering [A]why
i am underneath this [F#m7]big old sky
[C9]Stopping the [B7]loving getting in [E]
        
Now you say it's [E]easy
That you been [G#m7]falling for all of my [Gm7,F#m7]charm
And getting [B7]lost in my smile
[E]Never ceases to [G#m7]amaze me
                      
When i'm [Gm7]chancing my [F#m7]arm
That i still [B7]do it with style
[Am]And now i [B7]hope
You'll be with me [E]tomorrow
With me [Am]tomorrow [B7]
