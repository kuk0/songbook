\begin{verbatim}
[G, C]
Under this national rain cloud I'm getting soaked to the skin
Trying to find my umbrella
But [Em]I don't know where to [Em7]begin[A7]

And it's simply irrational weather Can't even hear myself think
Constantly bailing out water But still like I'm gonna sink

[chorus]
[G, C]
Coz I'm under the weather just like the world
So [Em]sorry for [B]being so [Em]bo[D,C]ld

When I turn out the light you're out of sight
Although I know that I'm not alo..ne
Feels like home

You say you feel like a natural person You haven't got nothing to hide
So why do you feel imperfection Cut like a sword in your side

Coz you're under the weather Just like the world
And I need somebody to hold 
When I turn out the light You're out of sight
Although I know that I'm not alone
Feels like [B]ho[Em,C]me   
Feels like [B]ho[Em,C]me   
Feels like [B]ho[Em,C,D,G]me[C,F]
Yeah it [C]feels like [G]hoo[C,F,C]ome

Oh cos i'm under the weather just like the world
and i need somebody to hooold
When i turn out the light your out of sight
allthough I know that I'm not alone Feels like home
