[Am]
When they [C*]poured a[E*]cross the [Am]border
I was [C*]cautioned [E*]to sur[Am]render,
this [C]I could not [G]do;
[F] I took my gun and [C]vanished.[E, Am]

I have changed my name so often, I've lost my wife and children
but I have many friends, and some of them are with me.

An old woman gave us shelter, kept us hidden in the garret,
then the soldiers came; she died without a whis-per.

There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening
but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing, through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shad-ows.

Les Allemands etaient chez moi, ons m'a dit: "Resigne toi,"
mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon arme.

J'ai change cent fois de nom, j'ai perdu femme et enfants
mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France entiere.

Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a caches,
les Allemands l'ont prisent; il est mort sans surprise.

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing, through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.
