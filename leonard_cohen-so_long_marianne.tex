[G]Come over to the window my little [Am]darling
[C]I'd like to try to read your [G]palm
[F]I used to think I was some kind of [C]gypsy boy
[Em]Before I let you take me [D]home[D7]

Now [G]so long Marianne  it's [Em]time we began
To [D]laugh and cry and cry and [D7]laugh about it [G]all again

[G]Well you know that I love to [Am]live with you
[C]But you make me forget so very [G]much
[F]I forget to pray for the [C]angels
[Em]And then the angels forget to pray for [D]us[D7]

[G]We met when we were [Am]almost young
[C]Deep in the green Lilac [G]park
[F]You held on to me like I was a [C]crucifix
[Em]As we went kneeling thru the [D]dark[D7]

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now. Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web Is fastening my ankle to a stone.

For now I need your hidden love. I'm cold as a new razor blade.
You left when I told you I was curious, I never said that I was brave.

Oh, you are really such a pretty one. I see you've gone and changed your name again.
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside, To wash my eyelids in the rain!
