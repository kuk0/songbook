[E]Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can [A]hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her
And you [E]know that she's half-crazy, but that's why you wanna be there
And she [G#m]feeds you tea & oranges that come [A]all the way from China
And [E]just when you mean to tell her that you [A]have no love to give her
Then she [E]gets you on her wavelength & she [F#m]lets the river answer
That you've [E]always been her lover

chorus:
And you [G#m]want to travel with her, and you [A]want to travel blind
And you [E]know that she will trust you,
For you've [A]touched her perfect body with your [E]mind


And [E]Jesus was a sailor, when he walked upon the water
And he [A]spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And [E]when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him he said
[G#m]'All men will be sailors then, un[A]til the sea shall free them'
But [E]he himself was broken, long be[A]fore the sky would open
For[E]saken, almost human, he [F#m]sank beneath your wisdom like a [E]stone

And you [G#m]want to travel with him, and you [A]want to travel blind
And you [E]think maybe you'll trust him,
For he's [A]touched your perfect body with his [E]mind

Now [E]Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She is [A]wearing rags & feathers from Salvation Army counter
And the [E]sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour
And she [G#m]shows you where to look among the [A]garbage & the flowers
There are [E]heroes in the seaweed, there are [A]children in the morning
They are [E]leaning out for love, & they will [F#m]lean that way forever
While [E]Suzanne holds the mirror

And you [G#m]want to travel with her, and you [A]want to travel blind
And you [E]know you can trust her,
For she's [A]touched your perfect body with her [E]mind
