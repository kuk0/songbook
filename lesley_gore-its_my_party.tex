Chorus:

	 A                      A+
	It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
	 D                Dm
	Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
	A      F#m      Bm         E           A    D   A    E
	  You would cry too if it happened to you

Verse 1:

	 A                     C
	Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
	     A                  D
	But Judy left the same time
	 F          A
	Why was he holding her hand
	     B7                   E
	When he's supposed to be mine

[repeat chorus]

Verse 2:

	Play all my records, keep dancing all night
	But leave me alone for a while
	'Til Johnny's dancing with me
	I've got no reason to smile

[repeat chorus]

[instrumental break over chorus chords (substitute F# for F#m)]

Verse 3:

	Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
	Like a queen and her king
	Oh, what a birthday surprise
	Judy's wearing his ring

[repeat chorus; fade 2nd time]
