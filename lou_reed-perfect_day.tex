[Am]Just a [D]perfect day,
[G]Drink Sangria [C]in the park,
[F]And then later, when [Dm]it gets dark, 
We go [E]home.
[Am]Just a [D]perfect day,
[G]Feed animals [C]in the zoo
[F]Then later, [Dm]a movie, too,
And then [E]home.

[chorus]
Oh [A]it's such a [D]perfect day, 
[C#m]I'm glad I spent it with [D]you. [D/C#] [D/B]
[A]Oh such a [E]perfect day,
You just [F#m]keep me [E]hanging [D]on,
You just [F#m]keep me [E]hanging [D]on,

[Am]Just a [D]perfect day,
[G]Problems all [C]left alone,
[F]Weekenders [Dm]on our own.
It's such [E]fun.
[Am]Just a [D]perfect day,
[G]You made me for[C]get myself.
[F]I thought I was [Dm]someone else,
Someone [E]good.

[chorus]

[C#m]You're going to [G]reap just what you [D]sow, [D/C#] [D/B] [A]
[C#m]You're going to [G]reap just what you [D]sow, [D/C#] [D/B] [A]
[C#m]You're going to [G]reap just what you [D]sow, [D/C#] [D/B] [A]
[C#m] [G] [D] [D/C#] [D/B] [A]
