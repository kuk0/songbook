[D]Games, changes and [A]fears
When will they [Em]go from here
When will they [G]stop
I believe that [D]fate has brought us [A]here
And we should be [Em]together babe
But we're [G]not [A]

chorus:
[G]I play it off bit I'm [F#m]dreaming of you
[G]I'll keep my cool but I'm [A]fiendin

I try to say [D]goodbye and I choke
Try to walk [A]away but I stumble
Though I try to [Em]hide it, it's clear
My [G]world crumbles when you are [A]not near
[D]Goodbye and I choke
Try to walk [A]away and I stumble
Though I try to [Em]hide it, it's clear
My [G]world crumbles when you are [A]not near

[D]I may appear to be [A]free
But I'm just a [Em]prisoner of your [G]love
I may seem [D]alright and smile when you [A]leave
But my smiles are [Em]just a front, just a [G]front [A]

[chorus]

[F]Here is my con[Am]fession
May I be your pos[F]session?
Boy I need your [Em]touch
Your love kisses and [C7]such
With all my might I [Bm]try
But this I can't [Em]deny
[A]Deny

[G]I play it off bit I'm [F#m]dreaming of you
[G]I'll keep my cool but I'm [A]fiendin

I [Bb]try to say good[Eb]bye and I choke
Try to walk [Bb]away but I stumble
Though I try to [Fm]hide it, it's clear
My [G#]world crumbles when you are [Bb]not near
Good[Eb]bye and I choke
Try to walk [Bb]away but I stumble
Though I try to [Fm]hide it, it's clear
My world [G#]crumbles when you are [Bb]not near
