Chorus:
California [Am]dreamin' (Cali[Am7/G]fornia [F]dreamin')
On [G]such a winter's [E7sus4]day [E7]

Stopped in to a church
I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees
                      (got down on my knees)
And I pretend to pray (I pretend to pray)
You know the preacher likes the cold
                               (preacher likes the cold)
He knows I'm gonna stay (knows I'm gonna stay)

[F]I've been for a [C]walk (I've been [E7]for a [Am]walk)
On a [F]winter's [E7sus4]day  (on a winter's [E7]day)
If I didn't tell her
            (if I didn't tell her)
I could leave today (I could leave today)
