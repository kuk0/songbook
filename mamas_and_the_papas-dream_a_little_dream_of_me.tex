 C     Cdim            Ab    G 
Stars shining bright above you
 C     Cdim              A        A7
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
 F                  Fm
Birds singing in a sycamore tree
 C             Ab      G   G7
Dream a little dream of me.

Say "Nightie-night" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and lue as can be
 C              Ab  G  C    E7
Dream a little dream of me.

 A    F#m        Bm      E             A     F#m          Bm  E
Stars fading but I linger on, dear, still craving your kiss
 A    F#m        Bm         E             A    F#m      Ab G
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear, just saying this:

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me.
