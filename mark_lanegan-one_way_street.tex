Am                              Dm              Am    
The stars and the moon, aren't where they're supposed to be
Am                                Dm         Am
For the strange electric light, it falls so close to me
Am                  C             F           Am
Love,I come to the ride, I'm not sea sick, rolling wave
Am                      Dm               Am
And you know that I am, just trying to get out

Dm               E       C              Dm
Oh, the glorious sound, of the one way street
E                   G                        Am
But you can't get, can't get it down without crying

Am                               Dm      Am
When I'm dressed in white, send roses to me
Am                           Dm           Am
I drink so much sour whiskey I can hardly see
Am                  C                F                  Am
And everywhere I've been, there's a world that HOWLS my name
Am                         Dm            Am
From the one tiny sting, to that vacant fame

Dm                 E               C                      Dm
Oh, the deafening roar, remember that's called a one way street
E                    G                        Am
And you can't get, can't get it down without crying

Am                 Dm          Am
Mysteries aside, you can't get out
Am                          Dm          Am
It's like a tropic light, you can't get out
Am                  C              F              Am
Love I come to the ride, I'm not sea sick, rolling wave
Am                     Dm          Am
As away that I fall, trying to get out

Dm                 E     C               Dm
Oh, the glorious sound, of the one way street
E                     G                       Am
And you can't get, can't get it down without crying
