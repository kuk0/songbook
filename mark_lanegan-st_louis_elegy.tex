[Am, C, Dm, Am]
I look at the sky
I see an airplane as it flies
Is this the way they said Jesus came?
Gone through St. Louis
Gone straightaway
And i hear the winter will cut you quick
If tears were liquor I'd have drunk myself sick

Woman are you home?
A house of cards, a frame of bones
Here I am earthly bound
Said hallelujah I'm going down
And the River Jordan is deep and wide
I think I see forever across on the other side

I look at the sky
I see a nightbird as it flies
Over the old bent cherry trees
Shivering in a row
Down here the winter will cut you quick
These tears are liquor and I've drunk myself sick

And the dead of winter will cut you quick
These tears are liquor and I've drunk myself sick
