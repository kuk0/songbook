Intro:
Em (Top 4 strings picked slowly down then up) x 4

Verse 1:
[Em]She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean [Am]I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the [Em]round
She said [Am]I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the [Em]round

[Em]She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of [Am]being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the [Em]round

Bridge:
[C]People always told me be [Em]careful of what you do
Don't [C]go around breaking young girls' [Em]hearts
And [C]mother always told me be [Em]careful of who you love
And be [C]careful of what you do before the [B7]lie becomes the truth

Chorus:
[Em]Billie [Am]Jean is [Em]not my [Gadd9/E]lover
[Em]She's just a [Am]girl [Em]who says that I[Am] am the one[Bmadd11/A]
But the [Gadd11/A]kid is [Bm7/A]not my [Em]son
She says I[Am] am the one
But the [Gadd11/A]kid is [Bm7/A]not my [Em]son

Verse 2:
[Em]For forty days and for forty nights. The law was on her side.
But who can stand when she's in demand. Her [Am]schemes and plans.
'Cause we danced on the floor in the [Em]round
So take my[Am] strong advice, remember to always think [Em]twice
(Do think twice)

Verse 3:
[Em]She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried[Am] his eyes were like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the [Em]round

Bridge:
[C]People always told me be [Em]careful of what you do
Don't [C]go around breaking young girls' [Em]hearts
[C]Then she stood right by me. The [Em]smell of sweet perfume.
This [C]happened much too soon. [B7]She called me to her room.

Chorus:
[Em]Billie [Am]Jean is [Em]not my [Gadd9/E]lover
[Em]She's just a [Am]girl [Em]who says that I[Am] am the one[Bmadd11/A]
But the [Gadd11/A]kid is [Bm7/A]not my [Em]son
She says I[Am] am the one
But the [Gadd11/A]kid is [Bm7/A]not my [Em]son
[Em]So take my[Am] strong advice, remember to always think [Em]twice
(Do think twice)
