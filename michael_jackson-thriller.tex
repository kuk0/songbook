intro: [Am  C  D  Am7]

[D7]It's close to midnight, and [Am7]something evil's, lurking in the dark.
 Under the moonlight, you see a sight, that almost stops your heart.
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound, before you make it.
You start to freeze, as horror looks you right between the eyes;
[Fmaj7]You're para[Em]lyzed.

[chorus]
'Cos this is; [Am]Thril[C]ler, [D]Thriller [Am7]Night;
And [D7]no one's gonna save you from the [Dm7]beast about to strike.
You know it's; [Am]Thril[C]ler, [D]Thriller [Am7]Night;
You're [D7]fighting for your life, inside a [F7]killer, [D7]Thriller, [F/G]to[Am7]night.

You hear the door slam, and realise there's nowhere left to run.
You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagi-nation.
But all the while, you hear the creature creepin' up be-hind;
You're out of time.

[chorus]

[D7] Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their [Fmaj9]masque[G]rade.
[Am7] There's no escapin' the [C/G]jaws of the alien, this [Em7b5]time;
[Fmaj7]This is the end of your [E7sus4]life.[E7]

They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on every side.
They will possess you; un-less you change the number on your dial.
Now is the time, for you and I to cuddle close to-gether.
All through the night, I'll save you from the terror on the screen;
I'll make you see,

That this is; [Am]Thril[C]ler, [D]Thriller [Am7]Night;
'Cos [D7]I can thrill you more than any [Dm7]ghost would dare to try.
Girl, this is; [Am]Thril[C]ler, [D]Thriller [Am7]Night;
So [D7]let me hold you tight, and share a [F7]killer,
[D7] Diller, [F/G]chil[Am7]ler, Thriller here [C]tonight.

[coda, ad-lib: Am, F/A, G/A, D/A]
[spoken]
Darkness falls across the land, the midnight hour is close at hand.
Creatures crawl in search of blood, to terrorise y'awl's neighbourhood.
And whosoever shall be found, without the soul for getting down,
Must stand and face the Hounds of Hell and rot inside a corpse's shell.
The foulest stench is in the air; the funk of forty thousand years,
And grizzy ghouls from every tomb, are closing in to seal your doom.
And though you fight to stay alive; your body starts to shiver,
For no mere mortal can resist, the evil of The Thriller...
