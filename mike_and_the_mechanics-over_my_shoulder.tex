[Am7, D, G]
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eyes
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say good bye

Looking back over my shoulder
With an aching deep in my heart
I wish we were starting over
Oh instead we're drifting so far apart

[F, C, Bb, C]
Everybody told me you were leaving
Funny I should be the last to know
Baby, please, tell me that I'm dreaming
[Bb] I just never want to let you [C]go

[Am7, D, G]
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eyes
Turning my heart over and over
I never wanted to say good bye

[F, C, Bb, C]
I don't mind everybody laughing
But it's enough to make an old man cry
'cause I can feel you're slipping through my fingers
[Bb] I don't even know the reason [C]why

[Am7, D, G]
[F, C, Bb, C]
Everyday it's a losing battle
Just to smile and hold my head up high
Could it be we belong together
[Bb] Baby, won't you give me one more [C]try?
One more [A]try

[Am7, D, G]
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eyes
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say good bye
