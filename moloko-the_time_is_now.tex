[Dm, Em, Am]
You're my last breathe, you're a breathe of fresh air to me
Hi, I'm empty, so tell me you care for me

You're the first thing, and the last thing on my mind 
In your arms I feel [F]Sunshine[G]

On a promise a day dream yet to come 
Time is upon us, oh but the night is young 

Flowers blossom in the winter time 
In your arms I feel [F]Sunshine[G]

[chorus]
[Dm]Give up yourself unto the [Em]moment [F,Em]
[Dm]The time is [Em]now [F,Em]
[Dm]Give up yourself unto the [Em]moment [F,Em]
[F]Let's make this [G]moment last 

You may find yourself out on a limb for me
Could you expect it as a part of your destiny 

I give all I have but it's not enough
And my patience are shot so I'm calling your bluff 

[chorus 2x]

And we gave it time all eyes are on the clock
But time takes too much time please make the waiting stop 

And the atmosphere is charged in you I trust
And I feel no fear as I do as I must

[chorus]

Tempted by faith and I won't hesitate 
The time is now  letâ€™s make this moment last (the night is young)

[Dm,Em,F,Em]
The time is now 
[F]Let's make this [G]moment last
