Dm|Dm|Bb|Bb|
They wanted me here  Just to show you my face
But when it comes to the crunch I just hide in disgrace
You're calling me mad But i know you're the same
Cause you got to be seen to be playing the game
|Am|Am|Gm|Gm|
Yes we got to be seen to be playing, the game

Chorus:
|Dm|Dm|Gm|C| repeat
|Am|Am|Gm|Gm

It ain't gonna hurt now If you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now Everytime you criticise
I'm under your curse now But I call it compromise
I thought that you were wise
But you were otherwise

A specimen like you I would love to obtain
I asked a tedious guy if he'd tell me your name
I'd love to impress you With a back summersault
I wanna take up your love But it's locked in a vault
I wanna take up your love But it's locked in a vault

[chorus]

When i open my mouth
thoughts are brutally honest
And i can't expect that kind of love from you
When you open your mouth
Your teeth are beautifully polished
And i can't extract the pain you're going through
No i can't explain
The pain you're going through

It ain't gonna hurt now If you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now Everytime you womanise
I'm under your curse now But I call it compromise
I'm under your curse

[chorus]
