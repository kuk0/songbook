intro: [Gm,  F, Dm, A/C#, Dm, F/C, A#]

[Gm]You're the night, [F]Lilah.
[Dm]A little girl [A/C#]lost in the woods.
[Dm]You're a folk tale,[F/C]the unexplainable[A#]

chorus:
[Gm]You're a bedtime [F]story.
[A/E]The one that keeps the curtains [Dm]closed.
[Gm]I hope you're waiting [F]for me
[A/E]cause I can't make it on my [Dm]own.
[A/E]I can't make it on my [Dm]own.

[Gm]It's too dark to see the [F]landmarks.
[Dm]I don't want your good luck [A/C#]charms.
[Dm]I hope you're waiting for [F/C]me
across your carpet of [A#]stars.
[Gm]You're the night, [F]Lilah.
[Dm]You're everything that we can't [A/C#]see.
[Dm]Lilah, [F/C]you're impossibility.[A#]

chorus

[Gm,  F, Dm, A/C#, Dm, F/C, A#]

[Gm]Unknown the unlit world of old.
You're the [F]sounds I never heard before.
[Dm]Off the map where the wild things grow.
[A/C#]Another world outside my door.
[Dm]Here I stand I'm all alone.
[F/C]Drive me down the pitch black road.
[A#]Lilah you're my only home and I can't make it on my own.

chorus

outro:
You're the paint can falling off the wall
at the door that slams at the end of the hall
where the kid rings sounds of basketball.
The battle of the earth of the angels.
The shifting snow drifts so realistic, so realistic
- call you of stars. See there is something in the yard.
It's awful dark. With the painted strings,
the good luck charm, the prayer, the extra layer...
