\begin{verbatim}
[Bm]On my first day back, [A]first day back in town
[Bm]First day, my [A]first day back in town
[Bm]The clouds up above, they were [A]humming our song
[Bm]Humming, humming our [A]song

[Bm]My biggest fear is [A]if I let you go,
[G]You'll come and get me in my [F#]sleep
[Bm]My biggest fear is [A]if I let you go,
[G]You'll come and get me in my [F#]sleep
Come and [Bm]get me.[A, Bm, A]

I set my course, sailed away from shore
Steady, steady as she goes
I crash in the night, two worlds collide
But when two worlds collide no one survives no one survives and
The reddest of reds, the bluest of blues
The saddest of songs I'll sing for you.

My biggest fear is if I let you go,
You'll come and get me in my sleep
My biggest fear is if I let you go,
You'll come and get me in my sleep
Come and get me. Come and get me in my sleep.
