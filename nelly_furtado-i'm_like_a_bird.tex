Intro:  [Em, G, Am, C]
you're [G]beautiful, that's for [Em]sure
you'll [G]never ever [D]fade
you're [G]lovely but it's not for [Em]sure
that [G]i won't ever [D]change

and though my love is [C]ra[D]re
though my love is [C]tru[D]e

[chorus:]
[G]i'm like a bird, i'll only fly [D]away
I don't know where my [Am]soul is, i don't know where my [C]home is
(and baby all I need for you to know is)
[G]i'm like a bird, i'll only fly [D]away
i don't know where my [Am]soul is, i don't know where my [C]home is
 (all i need for you to know is)

your [G]faith in me brings me to [Em]tears,
even [G]after all these [D]years
and it [G]pains me so much to [Em]tell,
that [G]you don't know me that [D]well

and though my love is [C]ra[D]re
though my love is [C]tru[D]e

[chorus]

it's [C]not that i wanna say goodbye
it's [Em]just that every time you try 
to [C]tell me that you [D]love me
[C]each and every single day [Em]i know
i'm going to have to eventually [C]give you [D]away-yeh-yeah

and though my love is [C]ra[D]re
and though my love is true
hey i'm just scared
that we may fall through
[chorus]
