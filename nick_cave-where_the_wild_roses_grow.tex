[chorus]
They [Gm]call me The Wild [Cm]Rose[Gm]
But my [Bb]name was Elisa [D]Day
Why they [Gm]call me it I do not [Cm]know[Gm]
For my [Gm]name was [F]Elisa [Gm]Day 

From the [Gm]first day I saw her I knew [Bb]she was the one
As she [Cm]stared in my eyes and [D]smiled
For her [Gm]lips were the color of the [Bb]roses
They [Cm]grew down the river, all [D]bloody and wild 

When he [Gm]knocked on my door and [Bb]entered the room
My [Cm]trembling subsided in [D]his sure embrace
He would [Gm]be my first man, and [Bb]with a careful hand
He [Cm]wiped the tears that [D]ran down my face 

[chorus]

On the [Gm]second day I brought her a [Bb]flower
She was more [Cm]beautiful than any [D]woman I'd seen
I said, [Gm]"Do you know where the [Bb]wild roses grow
[Cm]So sweet and scarlet and [D]free?" 

On the [Gm]second day he came with a [Bb]single rose
Said: "Will you [Cm]give me your loss and your [D]sorrow?"
I [Gm]nodded my head, as I [Bb]lay on the bed
He said, "If I [Cm]show you the roses will you [D]follow?" 

[chorus]

On the [Gm]third day he took me to the [Bb]river
He [Cm]showed me the roses and we [D]kissed
And the [Gm]last thing I heard was a [Bb]muttered word
As he stood [Cm]smiling above me with a [D]rock in his fist 

On the [Gm]last day I took her where the [Bb]wild roses grow
And she [Cm]lay on the bank, the wind [D]light as a thief
As I [Gm]kissed her goodbye, I said, "All [Bb]beauty must die"
And I [Cm]lent down and planted a [D]rose between her teeth
