Ami
get down, get down, little henry lee
                        Dmi
and stay all night with me
you won't find a girl in this damn world
                       Ami
that will compare with me
             G
and the wind did howl and the wind did blow

Chorus:
C
la la la la la
Ami
la la la la lee
  Dmi                           Ami
a little bird lit down on henry lee

i can't get down and i won't get down
and stay all night with thee
for the girl i have in that merry green land
i love far better than thee
and the wind did howl and the wind did blow

Chorus

she leaned herself against a fence
just for a kiss or two
and with a little pen-knife held in her hand
she plugged him through and through
and the wind did roar and the wind did moan

Chorus

come take him by his lilly-white hands
come take him by his feet
and throw him in this deep deep well
which is more than one hundred feet
and the wind did howl and the wind did blow

Chorus

lie there, lie there, little henry lee
'till the flesh drops from your bones
for the girl you have in that merry green land
can wait forever for you to come home
and the wind did howl and the wind did moan
Chorus
