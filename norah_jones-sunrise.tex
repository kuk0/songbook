Sunrise Sunrise 
Bb                 Eb 
Looks like morning in your eyes
Cm                 Eb Ab Eb
But the clocks held 9:15 for hours 
Gm7     Cm
Sunrise Sunrise 
Bb                      Eb
Couldn't tempt us if it tried 
Cm           Eb        Ab            Eb
Cuz the afternoon's already come and gone 

And I said 
Cm   Bb  Eb  Ab
Oooooooooooooooo (3x)
Fm7
To you 
Bb       Cm
Surprise Surprise 
Bb               Eb
Couldn't find it in your eyes 
Cm              Eb           Ab      Eb
But I'm sure its written all over my face 
Gm7      Cm
Surprise Surprise 
Bb                      Eb
Never something I could hide
Cm            Eb      Ab             Eb
When I see we made it through another day 

Then I say 
Cm  Bb  Eb  Ab
Ooooooooooooooo (3x)
Fm7
To you 
F/A      Ab
And now the night 
Ab                   F/A 
Will throw its cover down on me again 
F/A
And if I'm right 
Ab
It's the only way to bring me back 

Cm  Bb  Eb  Ab Fm7
oooooooooooooo To you
