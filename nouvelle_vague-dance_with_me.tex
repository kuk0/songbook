Dm                      Am 
Let's dance little stranger 
Dm              Am    G 
Show me secret sins 
Dm                  Am 
Love can be like bondage 
Dm              Am    G 
Seduce me once again 
 
Burning like an angel who has heaven in reprieve 
Burning like the voodoo man with devils on his sleeve 
 
G                    Dm 
Won't you dance with me 
F      C    F     C 
In my world of fantasy 
G                    Dm 
Won't you dance with me 
F     C  F    C 
Ritual fertility 
 
Like an apparition you don't seem real at all 
Like a premonition of curses on my soul 
 
The way I want to love you well it could be against the law 
I've seen you in a thousand minds  you've made the angels fall 
 
Won't you dance with me in my world of fantasy 
Won't you dance with me ritual fertility 
 
Come on little stranger there's only one last dance 
Soon the music's over let's give it one more chance 
 
Won't you dance with me in my world of fantasy 
Won't you dance with me ritual fertility 
 
Take a chance with me in my world of fantasy 
Won't you dance with me ritual fertility
