\begin{verbatim}
Bm
Came in from the city walked into the door
G (bar)
I turned around when I heard the sound of footsteps on the floor
Em
Love just like addiction now Im hooked on you
Bm
I need some time to get it right
A
Your love gonna see me through

Chorus
Bm            G
Cant stop now dont you know 
A             Fis
I aint never gonna let you go
Bm
Dont go

Baby make your mind up give me what you got
Fix me with your lovin shut the door and turn the lock
Hey go get the doctor, doctor came too late
Another night I feel alright my love for you cant wait

Chorus

Came in from the city walked into the door
I turned around when I heard the sound of footsteps on the floor
Said he was a killer, now I know its true Im dead when you walkout the door
Hey babe Im hooked on you

Repeat chorus
