[Dm]You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt
[C]And I'm hurt
[Dm]And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you
[C]And that's worse

[Dm]Ever fallen in love with [C]someone
Ever fallen in [Dm]love
In love with [C]someone
Ever fallen in [Eb]love
In love with [Bb]someone
You shouldn't've fallen in [C]love with

[Dm]I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out what's to blame
[C]What a shame (oh what a shame)
[Dm]And we can't be together
Until we realize that we are 
[C]the same

[Dm,C,Dm,C,Eb,Bb,C]
