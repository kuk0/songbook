\begin{verbatim}
Well i'm a human fly
it's spelt F-L-Y
I say buzz,buzz,buzz
And it's just because
I'm a human fly
And I don't know why
I got ninety six tears
In ninety six eyes

I got a garbage brain
It's drivin' me insane
And I don't like it
So I push that pesticide
And baby I don't care
'Cause baby I don't scare
'Cause I'm a reborn maggot using germ warfare
Ah Zzzzzzz...
Rock'n'roll...

I'm a human fly
it's spelt F-L-Y
I say buzz,buzz,buzz
And it's just because
I'm a unzipped fly
And I don't know why
And i don't know but I say buzz
