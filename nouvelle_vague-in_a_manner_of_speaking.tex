intro: [Am, C, F, E, E2]

[Am]In a Manner of speaking
I just want to [C]say
That I could never forget the [F]way
You told me everything
By saying [E]nothing [E2]

[Am]In a manner of speaking
I don't under[C]stand
How love in silence becomes [F]reprimand
But the way that i feel about you
Is [E]beyond words [E2]

[chorus]
[Am]Oh give me the [Am/G]words
Give me the [F]words
[E]That tell me [E2]nothing
[Am]Ohohohoh give me [Am/G]the words
Give [F]me the words
That [E]tell me [E2]everything

[Am]In a manner of speaking
Semantics won't [C]do
In this life that we live we only make [F]do
And the way that we feel
Might have to be [E]sacrified [E2]

[Am]So in a manner of speaking
I just want to [C]say
That just like you I should find a [F]way
To tell you everything
By saying [E]nothing. [E2]
