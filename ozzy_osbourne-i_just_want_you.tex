Em             D         
There are no unlockable doors
Am7            Em             
there are no unwinable wars
there are no unrightable wrongs
or unsingable songs 
there are no unbeatable odds
there are no beliveable gods 
there are no unameable names 
should i say it again yeah 
there are no impossible dreams
there are no invisible seams 
each night when the day is through 
i dont ask much i just want you 
i just want you

There are no uncriminal crimes 
there are no unrhymable rhymes 
there are no identical twins 
or forgivable sins 
there are no incurable ills
there are no unkillable thrills
