Intro: Bm, G, A, Bm, G, A, Bm
Verse:
Bm      G          A            Bm
take me now, baby, here as i am.
      G           A      Bm
pull me close try and understand.
        G          A         Bm
desire is hunger, is the fire i breathe.
        G        A          Bm
love is a banquet on which we feed.
G       A             D     A
come on now, try and understand
    Bm    G                         A
the way i feel when i'm in your hand.
D       G                  A
take my hand; come under cover.
     C                     Bm              F#
they can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.
Chorus:
Bm      G                   A
because the night belongs to    lovers.
Bm      G                   A   Bm
because the night belongs to    lust.
        G                   A
because the night belongs to    lovers.
Bm      G            A Bm
because the night belongs to    us.
Second verse:
have i doubt when i'm alone?
love is a ring on the telephone.
love is an angel disguised as lust,
here in our bed until the morning comes.
come on now, try and understand
the way i feel under your command.
take my hand as the sun descends.
they can't touch you now, can't touch you now, can't touch you now.
Repeat chorus
Ending:
     D    A             D          A               Bm    A
with love we sleep; with doubt the viscious circle turn and turns.
D     A          Bm      A    D         A
without you i cannot live, forgive the yearning, burning
    G     D    G
i believe in time, too real to feel,
   Bm        D             G              F#
so touch me now, touch me now, touch me now.
Repeat chorus and fade.
