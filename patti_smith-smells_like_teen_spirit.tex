Capo on 3rd
Am D C F
Load up on guns bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's overboard myself assured
I know, I know a dirty word

Chorus:
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello!
With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto An albino
A mosquito My libido
Yeah

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Chorus

And I forget Just what it takes
And yet I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard Its hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

Hello, hello, hello, hello, Hello, hello, hello!

The empty hand of innocence
transfusing street of the sorrows
and children of the wood
Hounded, shredding all veils
and winding all sheets of the dead world droning
Overturning tables laden with silver sacrificial birds
Beating goat-skin drums
Advancing with hands out-stretched
and we keep filling them with mercury nitrate, asbestos
Baby bombs blasting blue
Scavengers picking through the ashes
Children of the mills!
Children of the junkyards!
Sleepy, illiterate, fuzzy little rats
haunted, paint-sniffin',
stoned out of their shaved heads
Forgotten, foraging, mystical children
Foul-mouthed, glassy eyed, hallucinating

Chorus
