Intro: [A, F#m; E, A; F#m, E]

[E, F#m]
You gave me something, I understand.
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand

[chorus:]
[A, F#m]
I can't tell you how I feel
my heart is, like a [E] wheel

[E]Let me [A]roll it
let me roll it to you
let me roll it
let me roll it to you [E]

[F#m, E]

I want to tell you, and now's the time
I want to tell you that you're going to be mine

[chorus]
[F#m, E]
[chorus]

[E, F#m]
You gave me something I understand
you gave me loving in the palm of my hand
