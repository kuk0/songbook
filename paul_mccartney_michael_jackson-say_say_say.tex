[Bm, E, Em, Bm]

[Bm]Say say say what you [E]want
But don't [Em]play games with my [Bm]affection
[Bm]Take take take what you [E]need
But don't [Em]leave me with no [Bm]direction

(Michael Jackson)
[Em]All alone I sit home [G]by the phone
Waiting [Bm]for you, baby
[Em]Through the years how can you [G]stand to hear
My pleadin' [F#]for you dear, you know I'm crying
Hoo hoo hoo

[intro]

[Bm]Go go go where you [E]want
But don't [Em]leave me, here [Bm]forever
[Bm]You you you stay [E]away 
So long [Em]girl, i see you [Bm]never

What can [Em]I do girl, to get [G]through to you
'Cause I [Bm]love ya, baby
[Em]Standin' here, baptized in [G]all my tears
Baby [F#]through the years, you know I'm crying
Hoo Hoo Hoo

[intro]
[Em]You never [Bm]ever worry
And [A]you never [Bm]shed a tear
[Em]You're sayin' that my [Bm]love ain't real
Just [A]look at my face these tears ain't dryin'

You you you, can never say 
That I'm not the one, who really loves you
I pray pray pray, everyday
That you'll see things, girl like I do

What can I do girl, to get through to you
'Cause I love you, baby
Standin' here, baptized in all my tears
Baby through the years, you know I'm cryin'
Hoo Hoo Hoo
