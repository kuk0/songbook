[F#m, D]
Since you've been [F#m]gone
I shut my eyes and I fantasize
That you're here with [D]me

Will you ever return?
I want be satisfied 'till you're by my side
Don't wait any longer...

Why don't you come [F#m]back? Please [D]hurry...
Why don't you come back? Please hurry...

Come back and [F#m]stay for [A]good this [D]time
Come back and stay for good this time

When you said goodbye
I was trying to hide what I felt inside
Until you passed me by

You said you'd return
You said that you'd be mine 'till the end of time
Don't wait any longer!

Why don't you come back? Please hurry
Why don't you come back? Please hurry

Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time

Since you've been gone...
I opened my eyes and I realize
What we had together

Will you ever return?
I'll have you change your mind if you won't stay mine
Just love me forever!

Why don't you come back? Please hurry
Why don't you come back? Please hurry

Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time
Don't ever leave me...
