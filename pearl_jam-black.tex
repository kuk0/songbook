E               A     Asus4 A
sheets of empty canvas
          E                   A Asus4 A
untouched sheets of clay
E                 A
they spread out before me
       E
as her body once did

E           A     Asus4 A
all five horizons,
          E             A                     Asus4 A
revolved around her soul (as the earth to the sun)
E             A
now the air i tasted and breathed,
    E
has taken a turn
     C                                   Em
oooh and all i taught her was... everything
     C                               Em
oooh i know she gave all... that she wore
       D
and my bitter hands
        C
shake beneath the clouds
                 Em
of what was everything
        D                      C
all the pictures have all been washed in black
             Em
tatooed everything.

  E      A           Asus4 A
i take a walk outside
       E               A            Asus4 A
i'm surrounded by some kids at play
E                A
i can feel their laughter
   E
so why do i sear?

    C                                          Em
ooh and twisted thoughts that spin round my head (i'm spinnin')
         C                              Em
oooh i'm spinning how quick the sun can drop awayayayayay
       D
and my bitter hands
   C
cradle broken glass
                 Em
of what was everything
       D                      C
all my pictures have all been washed in black
Em
tatooed everything

       D
all my love gone bad
          C
turned my world to black
            D
tatooed all i see
         C
all that i am
              Em
all that i'll beeeeee    yeaahheah

  D
i know some day you'll have a beautiful life
  C
i know you'll be a sun,
   Em                  D              C
in somebody elses sky, whyhy, whyhy   whyhy
                            Em
can't it be, can't it be in mine.
