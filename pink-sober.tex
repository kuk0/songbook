\begin{verbatim}
[C#m, A, E, B]
I don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never wants to be alone
I don't wanna be that call at 4 o'clock in the morning
'Cos I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home
A------h the sun is blinding
I----      stayed up again
O----h, I am finding
That's not the way I want my story to end

[chorus:]
I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain
Inside
You're like perfection
How do I feel this good sober?

I don't wanna be the girl who has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation
I won't remember, save your breath, 'cos what's the use?

A----h, the night is calling?
And it whispers to me softly come and play
A----h, I am falling
And If I let myself go I'm the only one to blame 

[chorus]

I'm coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
Looking for myself - sober [x2]

When it's good, then it's good, it's so good till it goes bad
Till you're trying to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again
Broken down in agony just trying find a fit

[chorus x2]
