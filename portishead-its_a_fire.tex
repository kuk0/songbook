[Dm, E (2x)]

[Gsus4]It's a [G]fire,
These [Bm]dreams they pass me [G]by,
The sal[F]vation I desire,
[C]Keeps getting me [G]down.

[Gsus4]'Cause we need [G]to,
Recog[Bm]nize mis[G]takes,
For time and [F]again.[E]
[B]So let it be known,
For what we be[Abm]lieve in,
[F#]I can see no [F#m]reason,
For it to [C#m]fail.[Ab]

Chorus
'Cause this [F#]life is a [C#]farce,
I can't [B]breathe through this [F#]mask,
Like a [C#]fool,
So breathe [B]on, [F#]sister, breathe [C#]on.

[Dm, E]
 
From this oneself,
Testify or tell,
It's fooling us now,

So let it be known,
For what we believe in,
I can see no reason,
For it to fail.

'Cause this life is a farce,
I can't breathe through this mask,
Like a fool
So breathe on, little sister, breathe on,
Oh, so breathe on, little sister, like a fool
