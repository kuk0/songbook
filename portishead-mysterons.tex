Bbm              Bm
Inside you're pretending,
Look 'round you've been swept aside,
Somewhere, where they can forget

Divine, a buried chain
Still holding on,
This ocean will not be grasped

All for nothing
Did you really want (*4)

Refuse to surrender,
Strung out until ripped apart,
Who dares,
Who dares to condemn?

All for nothing
Did you really want (*4)
\end{verbatim}
