\begin{verbatim}
I wonder why
I don't know what you see
Of course I care
I won't pretend

It's just a thought
I've said enough
Don't you know life turns me
Always wants me
I can hardly pray

I could try
But don't know what you hear
'Cause in my heart
You were so clear

It's just a thought
I've said enough
Don't you know life turns me
Always wants me
I can hardly pray

On your stage
A show that you create
All by yourself
I am nowhere

You never noticed
You were so sure
Don't you know life turns me
Always wants me
I can hardly pray
