\begin{verbatim}
oh, can't anybody see, we've got a war to fight,
never found our way, regardless of what they say.

how can it feel, this wrong,
from this moment,
how can it feel, this wrong.

storm, in the morning light,
i feel, no more can i say, frozen to myself.

i got nobody on my side,
and surely that ain't right,
surely that ain't right.
