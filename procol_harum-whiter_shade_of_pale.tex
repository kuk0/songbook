[C]We [C/H]skipped the light [Am]fandango[Am/G]
[F]and turned [F/E]cartwheels 'cross the [Dm]floor[Dm/C]
[G7]I was [G7/F]feeling kind of [Em]sea sick[G7]
[C]but the [C/H]crowd called out for [Am]more[Am/G]
[F]the [F/E]room was humming [Dm]harder[Dm/C]
[G7]As the [G7/F]ceiling flew [Em]away[G7]
[C]When we [C/H]called out for another [Am]drink[Am/G]
[F]the [F/E]waiter brought a [Dm]tray

chorus:
[G7]And [G7]so [G7]it [C]was[C/H] that [Am]later[Am/G]
[F]As the [F/E]miller told his [Dm]tale[Dm/C]
[G7]That her [G7/F]face at first just [Em]ghostly
[G7]Turned a [C]whiter [F]shade of [C]pale[G]

[C]She [C/H]said there is no [Am]reason[Am/G]
[F]and the [F/E]truth is plain to [Dm]see[Dm/C]
[G7]but I [G7/F]wandered through my [Em]playing cards[G7]
[C]would [C/H]not let her [Am]be[Am/G]
[F]one of [F/E]sixteen vessel [Dm]virgins[Dm/C]
[G7]who were [G7/F]leaving for the [Em]coast[G7]
[C]And although my [C/H]eyes were [Am]open[Am/G]
[F]They [F/E]might just as well've been [Dm]closed
