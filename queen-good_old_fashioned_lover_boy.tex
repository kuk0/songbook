 I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things,
Dm7            F     G7       C   G7
 We can do the tango just for two.
C                          F            Em    Am
 I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings;
Dm7            Fm   G7       C   G7
 Be your Valen-tino just for you.

C     G7/B  Am   Em F   C   G7/B              Am         E7/Ab
 Ooh, love, ooh, lo-ver boy, what're doing to-night, hey boy?

Set my a-larm, turn on my charm,
          Dm7                  Fm        G7    C
That's be-cause I'm a good old fashioned lover boy.

Fm                     C/E              Edim C/E Edim C/E
 Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat, (grow fast-er, fast-er),
Fm   Eb7              Ab        Eb7
 Ooh, can you feel my love heat?
                      Ab          Eb7
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love and tell me;
Ab          G7               C
 How do you feel right after all?
                     F          Em  Am
I'd like for you and I to go ro-man-cing;
Dm7                 Fm      G7     C    G7
 Say the word, your wish is my com-mand.

 Write my letter, feel much better,
    Dm7          Fm            G7   C
And use my fancy patter on the tele-phone.

 When I'm not with you, think of you always,

(I miss those long hot summer nights), I miss you.

I love you, love you.

 Hey boy, where did you get it from? Hey boy, where did you go?
  Dm                        Fm                 G7              C
I learned my passion in the good old fashioned school of lover boys.

 Driving back in style in my sa-loon, will do quite nice-ly,

Just take me back to yours, that will be fine.
