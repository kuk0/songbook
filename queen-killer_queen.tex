She keeps [Am]Moet and Chandon [G7/B]in her pretty cabinet.
[Am] "Let them eat cake", she says, [G7/B]just like Mary [C]Antoinette.
A [C]built in [Em]remedy for [C7]Khrushchev and [F]Kennedy,
And [Fm]any time, an [C/G]invitation, [F/G]you can't de[G7]cline.

[G] Killer [Bm]Queen, [Em]gunpowder, [Bm]gelatine,
[Em]Dynamite with a [F#7]laser [Bm]beam.
[E7]Guaran[D/F#]teed to [E7/G#]blow your [A]mind; [G]any time, ooh...

Drop of a [E7]hat, she's as [Am]willing as, [E7]playful as a [Am]pussycat.
Then [G]momentarily [C]out of action, [G]temporarily [C]out of gas;
To [B7]absolutely [Em]drive [D]you...
[G]Wi[D]ld, [Gm]wi[D]ld... she's [D7]out to get you! She's a...
