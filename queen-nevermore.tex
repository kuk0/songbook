[F]There's no living in my life [Dm]anymore.
The [C]seas have gone dry and the [Bb]rain stopped [F]falling.
[F]Please don't you cry [Dm]anymore
Can't you [Am]see
Bb            F       Bb            F
[Bb]Listen to the [F]breeze, [Bb]whisper to me [F]please
        G                          C    C7  F
Don't [G]send me to the path of nevermo[C, C7, F]re.

[F]Even the valleys [Dm]below
Where the [C]rays of the sun
Were so [Bb]warm and [F]tender
[F]Now haven't anything to [Dm]grow
Can't you [Am]see
Why [Bb]did you have to [F]leave me
[Bb]Why did you [F]deceive me

You [G]send me to the path of [C]nevermore
When you [A]say you didn't love me [Dm]anymore
[Bb, Am, Dm] (Ah - Ah)
[Bb]Nevermore,
[F]Nevermore.
