\begin{verbatim}
when you were here before,
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel,
your skin makes me cry

you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep,
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts,
i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul

i want you to notice
when i'm not around
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here, ohhhh, ohhhh

she's running out again
she's running
she runs runs runs runs...
runs...

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
you're so fucking special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep,
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here

i don't belong here...
