[chorus:]
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more,
no more, no more. Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more,
no more, no more. Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)

Woah Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean,
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen.
I guess if you say so
I have to pack ma things and go. (That's right)

[chorus]

well baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day.
(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)
(you ain't got no money you just ain't no good.)
Well, I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go. (That's right)

[chorus]
