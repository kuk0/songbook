\begin{verbatim}
[C]When I look up from my [Em]pillow I dream you are [Am]there with me
[C]Though you are far away [Em]I know you'll always be [Am]near to me

[chorus:]
I go to [Em]sleep[B]
And [Am]imagine that you're there with me
I go to [Em]sleep[B]
And [Am]imagine that you're there with me

[C]I look around me And [Em]feel you are ever so [Am]close to me
[C]Each tear that flows from my [Em]eye
Brings back memories of [Am]you to me

[chorus]

[G#]I was wrong, I will cry
I will love you till the [D#]day I die
[G#]You were all, you alone and no one else
You were [G]meant for [G7]me

[C]When morning comes again
[Em]I have the loneliness [Am]you left me
[C]Each day drags by
Until [Em]finally my time des[Am]cends on me

[chorus]
