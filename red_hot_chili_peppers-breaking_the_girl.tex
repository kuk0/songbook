[E, E6#11, Em7, E6sus4, Emaj9, E*]
i am a man, cut from the know
rarely do friends, come and then go
she was a girl, soft but estranged
we were the two, our lives rearranged

[G]feeling so [D]good that [Em]day
[G]a feeling of [D]love that [C]day

chorus:
[E]twisting and [D/F#]turning
your [G]feelings are [Am]burning
you're [B]breaking the [B/A]girl [B/G] [B/F#]
[Em]she [D/F#]meant [G]you [Am]no [C]harm
[Em]think you're so [D/F#]clever
but [G]now you must [Am]sever
you're [B]breaking the [B/A]girl [B/G] [B/F#]
[Em]he [D/F#]loves [G]no [Am]one [C]else[C7]

[E, E6#11, Em7, E6sus4, Emaj9, E*]
raised by my dad, girl of the day
he was my man, that was the way
she was the girl, left alone
feeling the need, to make me her home

[G]the twilight of [D]love had [C]arrived
