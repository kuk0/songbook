chorus:
[Am]How long how [F]long will I [C]slide
[G] Seperate my [Am]side [F]I [C]don't
[G] I don't believe it's [Am]bad [F]
[C] Slit my throat it's [G]all I ever

[Am]I heard your voice through a [Em]photogragh
[Am]It thought it up [Em]it brought up the past
[Am]Once you know you can [Em]never go back 
I've got to [G]take it on the [Am]otherside

[Am]Centuries are what it [Em]meant to me
[Am]A cemetery where I [Em]marry the sea
[Am]Stranger things could never [Em]change my mind
I've got to [G]take it on the [Am]otherside
[G]Take it on the [Am]otherside
[G]Take it on [Am]take it on

chorus
 
Poor my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut  
I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she is in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on take it on [Em, C]

chorus

[Em] Turn me on take me for a hard ride
[C]  Burn me out leave me on the otherside
[Em] I fell and tell it that it's not my friend 
[C]  I tear it down I tear it down and it's born again
[Am, F, C, G]

chorus

[Am]How [F]long I [C]don't I [G]don't believe it's [Am]bad[F]
[C]Slit my throat it's [G]all I ever[Am]
