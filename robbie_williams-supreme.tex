[Dm]Oh, it seemed fo[Gm]rever stopped today
all the [C]lonely hearts in London
Caught a [F]plane and flew away
And all the [Dm]best women are married
All the [Ab]handsome men are gay    
You feel [Asus4,A]deprived

[Dm]Yeah are you [Gm]questioning your size?
Is there a [C]tumour in your humour?
Are there [F]bags under your eyes?
Do you [Dm]leave dents where you sit?
Are you [Ab]getting on a bit?
Will you [Asus4]survive? You must [A]survive

[chorus]
When there's [Dm]no love in [Bb]town
This new centu[F]ry keeps bringing you [A]down
All the [Dm]places you have [Bb]been
Trying to [F]find a love [A]supreme
A love [Dm]supreme

[Dm]Oh, what are you [Gm]really looking for?
Another [C]partner in your life
To [F]abuse and to adore?
Is it [Dm]lovey dovey stuff?
Do you [Ab]need a bit of rough?
Get on your [Asus4]knees[A]
[Dm]Yeah turn down the [Gm]love songs that you hear
'Cause you [C]can't avoid the sentiment
That [F]echoes in your ear
Saying [Dm]love will stop the pain
Saying [Ab]love will kill the fear
Do you [Asus4]believe? You must [A]believe
[chorus]
