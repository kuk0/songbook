\begin{verbatim}
[chorus:]
[Em]Strumming my pain with his [Am]fingers
[D7]singing my life with his [G]words
[Em]killing me softly with [A]his song
killing me [D]softly with [C]his song
telling my [G]whole life with [C]his words.
Killing me [Esus4]softly
with his [E]song.

[Am7]I heard he [D]sang a good song
[G]I heard he [C]had a style
[Am7]and so I [D]came to see him
and [Em]listen for a while.
[Am7]And there he [D7]was this young boy
[G]a stranger [B7]to my eyes.

[chorus]

I felt all flushed with fever
embarrassed by the crowd.
I felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on.

[chorus]

He sang as if he knew me
in all my dark despair.
And then he looked right through me
as if I wasn't there.
And he just kept on singing
singing clear and strong.
[chorus]
