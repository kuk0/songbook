1.  Childhood living      is easy to do
   Am          G   C      D  G   Gsus4        G     D  Dsus2  D  C
    The things you wanted    I   brought them  for you
   Bm         G    Gsus4   Bm              G  Gsus4
    Graceless lady         you know who I am
   Am          G     C       D  G  Gsus4         G  D Dsus2 D
    You know I can't let you      slide through my hands

   Am     G  C      D  G         F       G  C     Bm
Ch. Wild     horses     couldn't drag me a- way
   Am        G  C      D G         F       G  C
    Wild wild   horses    couldn't drag me a- way

2.  I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
    Now you've decided to show me the same
    No sweeping exits or off-stage lines
    Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

[chorus]

Fsus2 C x 3
D G

3.  I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie
    I have my freedom but I don't have much time
    Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
    Let's do some living, after we'll die

[chorus]
