Intro:
Gm      F    G      x2
Duba dabu dubiduu....

Verse 1:
G                                Eb         F
There there used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
G              Eb            F  
You became the light on the dark side of me
G                  F               C            G
But love remains a drug that's the high not the pill
G                             Gm
But did you know that when it snows,
Eb             F             Eb             F              G
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can't be seen....

Chorus:
G                       Eb          F           G
Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
G                              F           G
Ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels
G                 Eb         F
And now that your rose is in bloom
Eb               F            G
A light hits the gloom on the grey

Intro x2

G                          Eb          F           G
There is so much a man can tell you so much he can say
G             Eb        F            G
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
G       Eb                       F                      G
Baby to me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
G                         Eb            F
Won't you tell me is that healthy baby
            G                 Gm
But did you know that when it snows,
   Eb          F             Eb             F               G
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can't be seen

A light hits the gloom on the bay
