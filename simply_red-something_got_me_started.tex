Something got me started
              Dm7
You know that I will love you
Lately since we parted
I truly know that I need you

[chorus]
I give it all up for you (4x)
I give it all up for you? yes I (3x)
I give it all up for you? yes I would

[Dm7 C  Dm7  G  C  x2]

Totally broken hearted
Guilty of what I did to you
Lately since we parted
I truly know that I need you

[chorus]
\end{verbatim}
