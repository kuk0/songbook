[E]They say we're young and [A]we don't know 
[E]We won't find out [A]un[D]til we [B]grow 
[E]Well I don't know if [A]all that's true 
[E]'Cause you got me, and [A]baby [D]I got [B]you 

[E]Babe, [A]I got [E]you babe [A]I got [E]you babe [A]

[E]They say our love won't [A]pay the rent 
[E]Before it's earned, our [A]money's [D]all been [B]spent 
[E]I guess that's so, we [A]don't have a pot 
[E]But at least I'm sure of [A]all the [D]things we [B]got 

[E]Babe, [A]I got [E]you babe [A]I got [E]you babe [A]

I got [F#m]flowers in the [B]spring
I got [F#m]you to wear my [B]ring
And when I'm [E]sad, you're a [A]clown
And if I get [E]scared, you're always [B]around[C]

[F]So let them say your [Bb]hair's too long 
[F]'Cause I don't care, with [Bb]you I [Eb]can't go [C]wrong 
[F]Then put your little [Bb]hand in mine 
[F]There ain't no hill or [Bb]mountain [Eb]we can't [C]climb 

[F]Babe, [Bb]I got [F]you babe [Bb]I got [F]you babe [Bb]

[F]I got you to [Bb]hold my hand 
[F]I got you to [C]understand 
[F]I got you to [Bb]walk with me 
[F]I got you to [C]talk with me 
I got you to kiss goodnight 
I got you to hold me tight 
I got you, I won't let go 
I got you to love me so 
I got you babe

I got you babe, I got you babe
I got you babe, I got you babe
