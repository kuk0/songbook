Em                      D-A D
Get your motor runnin'
Em                      D-A D
Head out on the highway
Em                      D-A D
Lookin' for adventure
Em                      D-A D
In whatever comes our way

 G       A           E
Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen

Take the world in a love embrace
 G    A          E                G  A         E
Fire all of the guns at once and explode into space

  Em
I like smoke and lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder
Wrestlin' with the wind
And the feelin' that I'm under

 G       A           E
Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
 G         A         E
Take the world in a love embrace
 G    A          E                G  A         E
Fire all of the guns at once and explode into space

        E
Like a true nature's child
         G      
We were born, born to be wild
           A            G             Em
We could climb so high, I never wanna die
 E          D    E  D 
Born to be wild,
 E          D    E  D 
Born to be wild,
