[Gmaj7, G7, Cmaj7]
   Do do do do, mmm-mmm-mmm,

As a[Gmaj7]round the sun, the [G7]earth knows she's
re[Cmaj7]volving,
And the [Gmaj7]rosebuds know to bloom in early [Fmaj7]May.
Just as [Gmaj7]hate knows [G7]love's the cure;
you can [Cmaj7]rest your mind assure,
That [Em7]I'll be [F#m7]loving you [Gm7]al[Em7]ways.[Am, D7]

       Gmaj7            G7            Cmaj7
As now can't reveal the mystery of to-morrow,
       Gmaj7                         Fmaj7
But in passing will grow older every day.
        Gmaj7   G7            Cmaj7         C6
Just as all, is new, you know what I say is true;
     Em7            F#m7 B7 Em
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.

[Em, Baug, Em7, A7]
 Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky, (always).
 Until the ocean covers every mountain high, (always).
 Until the dolphin flies, and parrots live at sea, (always).
 Until we dream of life and life becomes a [C#9]dream.

[Cmaj7]Did you know that true love asks for [Gmaj7]nothing?
[Cmaj7]Her acceptance is the way we [Fmaj7]pay.
[Cmaj7] Did you know that life has given [Gmaj7]love a guarantee?
To [Am7]last through forever another [B]day.[Am9, D13]

        Gmaj7             G7              Cmaj7
Just as time knew to move on since the be-gininning,
        Gmaj7                        Fmaj7
And the seasons know exactly when to change.
        Gmaj7             G7                   Cmaj7            C6
Just as kindness knows no shame; know through all your joy and pain;
     Em7            F#m7 B7 Em7  Em6  Am  D7
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.

      Gmaj7          G7             Cmaj7
As to-day I know I'm living, but to-morrow;
           Gmaj7                           Fmaj7
Could make me the past; but that I mustn't fear.
         Gmaj7           G7                Cmaj7           C6
For I'll know deep in my mind; the love of me I've left be-hind;;
     Em7            F#m7 B7 Em
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.

[Em, Baug, Em7, A7]
 Until the day is night and night becomes the day, (always).
 Until the trees and sea just up and fly a-way, (always).
 Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4, (always).
 Until the day, that is the day that are no more, (always).
 Until the day the earth starts turning right to left, (always).
 Until the earth just for the sun, denies it-self, (always).
 Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through, (always).
 Until the day that you are me and I am you, (always).
 Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky, (always).
 Until the ocean covers every mountain high, (always).
