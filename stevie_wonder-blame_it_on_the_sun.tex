 It seems dear love has gone a-way.

Chorus 1:
                         Am
But I'll blame it on the sun,
    Em              Am
The sun that didn't shine.

I'll blame it on the wind and the trees.

I'll blame it on the time,
     Em          Am
That never was e-nough.
     Em              Adim Cdim    Bm
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea.

 Is peace not here for me to see?

 Wish I could tell you,
Bm   F#   Bm
 How I am feeling.
Em                Am             D7    Dsus4 D
 But, words won't come for me to speak.

Chorus 2:

That never was e-nough.
