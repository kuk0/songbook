[intro: A, F#m, D, E, F#m]

Every breath you [A]take every move you [F#m]make
Every bond you [D]break every step you [E]take
I'll be watching [F#m]you
Every single [A]day every word you [F#m]say
Every game you [D]play every night you [E]stay
I'll be watching [F#m]you

[chorus]
Oh can't you [D]see
[C]You belong to [A]me how my poor heart [B]aches
With every step you [E]take

Every move you [A]make every vow you [F#m]break
Every smile you [D]fake every claim you [E]stake
I'll be watching [F#m]you

bridge:
[F]Since you've been gone, I've been lost without a trace
[G]I dream at night I can only see your face
[F]I look around but it's you I can't replace
[G]I feel so cold I long for your embrace
[F]I keep crying baby, baby [A]please

[A, F#m, D, E, F#m]

Every move you [A]make every vow you [F#m]break
Every smile you [D]fake every claim you [E]stake
I'll be watching [F#m]you
Every move you [D]make every step you [E]take 
I'll be watching [F#m]you
I'll be watching [A]you [F#m, D]
