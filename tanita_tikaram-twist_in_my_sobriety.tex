[Fm]All God's children need [Bbm]travelling shoes
[C]Drive your problems from here[Fm]
[Fm]All good people read[Bbm] good books
[C]Now your conscience is clear[Fm] I hear you talk girl
[C]Now your conscience is clear[Fm]

[Fm]In the morning when I [Bbm]wipe my brow
[C]Wipe the miles away[Fm]
[Fm]I'd like to think I can [Bbm]be so willed
[C]And never do what you say[Fm]
I'll never hear you
[C]And never do what you say[Fm]

[chorus:]
[Fm]Look my [C]eyes are just holograms[Fm]
Look your [C]love has drawn red from my hands[Fm]
From my hand[Bbm]s you know you'll never be[Fm]
More than [C]twist in my sobriety[Fm] [x2]

[Fm]We just poked a little[Bbm] empty pie
[C]For the fun the people [Fm]had at night
[Fm]Late at night don't need host[Bbm]ility
[C]Timid smile and [Fm]pause to free
[Fm]I don't care about their[Bbm] different thoughts
[C]Different thoughts are [Fm]good for me
[Fm]Up in arms and [Bbm]chaste the whole
[C]All God's children [Fm]took their toll

[chorus] [Fm][C/F][Fm][C][Fm][Bbm][C][C]

[Fm]Cup of tea take [Bbm]time to think yeah
[Fm]Time to risk a life[Bbm] for life for life
[Fm]Sweet and handsome [Bbm]Soft and porky
You [C]pig out 'til you've see the light[Fm]
[C]Pig out 'til you've see the light[Fm]
