[Am7]I don't [Cmaj7]want to see my[Bm7]self
[Am7]I don't [Cmaj7]want to see my[Bm7]self
[Bm7]Without [E7]you (repeat)

[verse 1]
Am7     Bm7  Am7     Bm7
Every time I pass in front of a looking glass
There's a smiling face
All because of the father's grace
I've a mirror on the wall what is the greatest love of all
Came down like a complete surprise
You changed my life before my eyes

[chorus]
[Am7]I don't want to see my[Bm7]self
I don't want to see myself
Don't wanna see myself without [E7]you

[verse 2]
Everyone I know has seen some problems come and go
I depend on you I need your grace to see me through
I was just a fallen star then I found out who you are
Whoa all the things you done for me will never fade from my memory
[repeat chorus & fade]
\end{verbatim}
