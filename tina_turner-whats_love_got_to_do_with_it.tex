\maketitle
\begin{verbatim}
[G#m, F#]
You must understand
That the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract

[E, F#]
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that
                        
[B, F#, E, F#]
Oh whats love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart
When a heart can be broken

[G#m, F#]
It may seem to you
That i'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If i tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
[E, F#]
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me

[chorus]

[Bbm, G#, F#, G#]
[B]I've been taking on a [C#]new direction
[B]But i have to [C#]say
[A]I've been thinking about my [B]own protection
[G#m]It scares me to feel this [C#]way

[chorus x2] [Bbm, G#, F#, G#]
