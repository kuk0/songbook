back in the crowd
tom waits


A
If you don’t want these arms to hold you
A
If you don’t want these lips to kiss you
A                            A7
If you’ve found somebody new
Bm                 E
Put me back in the crowd
Bm                     E
Put the sun behind the clouds
                   A
Put me back in the crowd


Bm               E
There’s a battle going on
           A             F#m
Between the blue and the grey
Bm
And if you don’t want my love
G                       E
Don’t make me stay


And so on and so forth...





Talking At The Same Time

Get a job, save your money, listen to Jane

Everybody knows umbrellas will cost more in the rain

All the news is bad
E                  Bm
Is there any other kind?
Bm                         F#    Bm
Everybody’s talking at the same time
          E              Bm       
Well it’s hard times for some
E               Bm
For others it’s sweet
E             Bm                 F#            Bm      
Someone makes money when there’s blood in the street
E              Bm  
Don’t take any lip
E       Bm
Stay in line
A                          F#        
Everybody’s talking at the same time...

And so on and so forth...
