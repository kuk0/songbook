well i woke up this morning with the cold water
with the cold water with the cold water
woke up this morning with the cold water
with the cold water with the cold

police at the station and they don't look friendly
well they don't look friendly well they don't look friendly
police at the station and they don't look friendly
no they don't look friendly well they don't

blind or crippled sharp or dull
i'm reading the bible by a 40 watt bulb
what price freedom dirt is my rug
well i sleep like a baby with the snakes and the bugs

well the stores are open but i ain't got no money
i ain't got no money i ain't got no money
stores are open but i ain't got no money
ain't got no money well i ain't

found an old dog and he seems to like me
seems to like me well he seems to like me
found an old dog and he seems to like me
seems to like me well he seems

seen them fellows with the card board signs
scrapin up a little dollars to buy a bottle of wine
pregnant women and the vietnam vets i say
beggin on the freeway bout as hard as it gets

well i slept in the graveyard it was cool and still
cool and still it was cool and still
slept in the graveyard it was cool and still
cool and still and it was cool

slept all night in the cedar grove
i was born to ramble born to rove
some men are searchin' for the holy grail
but there ain't nothin' sweeter
than ridin' the rails

i look 47 but i'm 24
well they shooed me away from here the time before
turned there their backs and they locked their doors
i'm watching t.v. in the window of a furniture store

well i woke up this morning with the cold water...
