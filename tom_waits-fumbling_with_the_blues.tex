[Am]Friday left me [E7]fumblin' with the blues[Am, E7, Am]
And it's [Am7]hard to [G7]win when [F7]you always [E7*]lose
Because the [Am7]nightspots [G7]spend your [F7]spirit
beat your [Am7*]head against the [D7]wall
[Am]two dead-ends you [E7]still got to choose[Am, E7, Am]

You know the bartenders they all know my name
and they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
and I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyester shaking my head
when I should be living clean in stead

You know the ladies I've been seeing off and on
well they spend your love then they're gone
you can't be loving someone who is savage and cruel
Take your love and then they leave on out of town... No they do...

When I'm falling in love, It's such a breeze
but it's standing up that's so hard for me
I wanna sqeeze you but I'm scared to death I'll break your back instead
You know your perfume, well it won't let me be

You know the bartenders they all know my name
and they'll catch me when I'm pulling up lame
and I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head
when I should be living clean in stead

so come on baby, let your love light shine
gotta bury me inside of your fire
cause your eyes are enough to blind me
you're like a-looking at the sun
you gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
come on and whisper tell me I'm the one
gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
come on and whisper tell me I'm the one
