   C                F                  G
i hope that i don't fall in love with you
       C          F                   G
cause falling in love just makes me blue
          F              C                F               C
well the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
  F              C              F              G
i had a beer and now i hear you calling out to me
      C                 F                 G
and i hope that i don't fall in love with you.

now the room is crowded, people everywhere
and i wonder should i offer you a chair
well if you sit down with this old clown,
he'll take that frown and break it
before the evening's gone away, i think that we could make it
and i hope that i don't fall in love with you

now the night does funny things inside a man
these old tomcat feelings you don't understand
i turn around and look at you, you light a cigarette
wish i had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
and i hope that i don't fall in love with you

and i can see that you are lonesome just like me
and i'm feeling like you'd like some company
well i turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
the guy you're with is up and split, the chair next to you's free
and i hope that you don't fall in love with me

now it's closing time, the music's fading out
last call for drinks i'll have another stout
i turn around and look at you, you're nowhere to be found
i search the place for your lost face, i guess i'll have another round
and i think that i just fell in love with you
