[Dm]Well she's  up against the register with [Bbm6]an apron and a spatula,    
[Fadd9/A]With yesterday's deliveries and the [Abdim]tickets for the bachelors    
[Gm7]She's a moving violation from her [A7sus4]conk down to her [A7]shoes,    
[Dm]But it's just an [Gm/Bb]invitation [A7]to the [Dm]blues    

[Gm]And you feel just like Cagney, [C7]she loks like Rita Hayworth    
[F]At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore    
You wonder [Gm]if she might be single, she's a [C7]loner and likes to mingle    
[F]  Got to be patient, try and [A]pick up a clue[A7, Dm/A, A7]

[Dm]She said "How you gonna like 'em, [Bbm6]over medium or scrambled?",    
[Fadd9/A]You say "Anyway's the only way", [Abdim]be careful not to gamble    
[Gm7]On a guy with a suitcase and a [A7sus4]ticket getting [A7]out of here    
[Dm]In a tired bus station in an [Bbm6]old pair of shoes    
[A7sus4]This ain't no thing but an [A7]invitation to the [Dm]blues    

[Gm]But you can't take your eyes off her, [C7]get another cup of java,    
[F]And it's jus t the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers    
Mercy [Gm]mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't [C7]nothing back in Jersey    
But a [F]broken-down jalopy of a [A]man I [A+]left [A7]behind
And a [Dm]dream that I was [Dm/C]chasing, [Bbm6]a battle with booze    
And an [A7sus4, A7] open invitation to the [Dm]blues   
  
[Gm]But she used to have a sugar daddy and a [C7]candy-apple Caddy,    
[F]And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things    
[Gm]He probably left her for a [Gm7]socialite, and he [C7]didn't love her 'cept at night,    
[F]And then he's drunk and never even [A]told her [A+]that he [A7]cared
[Dm]So they  took the [Dm/C]registration, [Bbm6] And the car-keys and her shoes    
And [A7sus4]left her with an [A7]invitation to the [Dm]blues    

[Gm]'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving [C7]local bus tonight, good evening    
[F]You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while    
[Gm]Get me a room at the Squire, [C7]the filling station's hiring,    
[F]And  I can eat here every night, what the [A]hell have I [A+]got to [A7]lose?    
[Dm]Got a crazy [Dm/C]sensation, [Bbm6] Go or stay? now I gotta choose,    
And I'll [A7sus4]accept your [A7]invitation to the [Dm]blues
