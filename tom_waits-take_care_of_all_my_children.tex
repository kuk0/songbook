Oh, take care of all of my children
      C                   G           C
For I don't know when I'm comin' back home

            F            C                E7/G#  Am
You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
F      C           G
Nail a sign on the door
           F            C               E7/G#   Am
Bright and early Sunday morning with my walking cane
    F           G      C
I'm going up to see my Lord

    C           Am            F  C
Oh, keep them together at the sundown
C             Am      G
Safe from the Devil's hand
          C           Am            F    C
You gotta make them a pillow on the hard ground
        C           G      C
I'll be goin' up to Beulah land

                F            C            E7/G#  Am

      C         Am              F C
Oh remember you never trust the Devil

Stay clear of Lucifer's hand
       C             Am            F  C
Oh and don't let 'em wander in the meadow
          C              G      C
Or you'll wind up in the fryin' pan

            F            C                E7/G#  Am
You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
