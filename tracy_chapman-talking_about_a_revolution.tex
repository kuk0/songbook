don't you know they're talkin' bout a revolution
it sounds like a whisper
don't you know they're talkin' bout a revolution
it sounds like a whisper

while they're standing in the welfare lines
crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
wasting time in the unemployment lines
sitting around waiting for a promotion

don't you know they're talkin' bout a revolution
it sounds like a whisper

poor people gonna rise up and get their share
poor people gonna rise up and take what's theirs

don't you know you better run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, ru-un
oh i said you better run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, ru-un

'cause finally the tables are starting to turn
talkin' bout a revolution
yes finally the tables are starting to turn
talkin' bout a revolution ohoh lord
talkin' bout a revolution ohoh 

while they're standing in the welfare lines
crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
wasting time in the unemployment lines
sitting around waiting for a promotion
don't you know they're talkin' bout a revolution
it sounds like a whisper

and finally the tables are starting to turn 
talkin' bout a revolution   
yes finally the tables are starting to turn
talkin' bout a revolution ohoh lord
talkin' bout a revolution ohoh lord
talkin' bout a revolution ohoh lord
