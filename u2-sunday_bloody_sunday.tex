[Bm, D, G6]
I can't believe the news today 
Oh, I can't close my eyes 
And make it go away 
[D] How long... [Em] How long must we sing this song? 
[D]How long? [E]How long... 
[Bm, D, G6]
'cause tonight....we can be as one; tonight... 

Broken bottles under children's feet; Bodies strewn across the dead end street 
But I won't heed the battle call; It puts my back up 
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, Bloody Sunday; Sunday, Bloody Sunday
[F]Sunday[Em], Bloody [D]Sunday

And the battle's just begun; There's many lost, but tell me who has won 
The trench is dug within our hearts; And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart 

Sunday, Bloody Sunday; Sunday, Bloody Sunday 
  
[D]How long... [Em]How long must we sing this song? 
[D]How long? [Em]How long... 

'cause tonight....we can be as one 
Tonight...      ....tonight 
Sunday, Bloody Sunday (tonight) Sunday, Bloody Sunday 

Wipe the tears from your eyes; Wipe your tears away 
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
Oh, wipe your blood shot eyes (Sunday, Bloody Sunday) 
F    Em          D                         F  Em D 
 Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday) 
F    Em          D                         F  Em D 
 Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday) 

And it's true we are immune; When fact is fiction and TV reality 
And today the millions cry; We eat and drink while tomorrow they die 
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
The real battle just begun; To claim the victory Jesus won 

Sunday, Bloody Sunday; Sunday, Bloody Sunday
